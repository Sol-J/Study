1,1,Would the human seasonal coronaviruses be just as deadly as COVID-19 in a population with no prior immunity?,"The seasonal coronaviruses attach exclusively to cells with a ciliated epithelium. Coronaviruses invade the respiratory tract via the nose. After an incubation period of about 3 days, they cause the symptoms of a common cold, including nasal obstruction, sneezing, runny nose, and occasionally cough (Figs. 60-1 and 60-2). The disease resolves in a few days, during which virus is shed in nasal secretions. There is some evidence that the respiratory coronaviruses can cause disease of the lower airways but it is unlikely that this is due to direct invasion. Other manifestations of disease such as multiple sclerosis have been attributed to these viruses but the evidence is not clear-cut. So, the mechanism of infection is such that they only attack the upper airways. The SARS-CoV-2 is totally different.  It attaches to the ACE2 surface receptor which is found deep in aleolar pneumocytes.  Their damage causes loss of surfactant in the alveloi, the collapse of these air cells that perform oxygen exchange and subsequently ARDS. So, seasonal coronaviruses give you a runny nose but don't kill.  SARS-Cov-2 collapses your air cells so you don't have any oxygen. Unlike the flu, there is no known treatment or vaccine, and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu, but the numbers are still uncertain.

There is a potential political cost for a government if they invest resources by precaution and the risk doesn't materialize.

  Studies in both organ cultures and human volunteers show that coronaviruses are extremely fastidious and grow only in differentiated respiratory epithelial cells. Infected cells become vacuolated, show damaged cilia, and may form syncytia. Cell damage triggers the production of inflammatory mediators, which increase nasal secretion and cause local inflammation and swelling. These responses in turn stimulate sneezing, obstruct the airway, and raise the temperature of the mucosa.


So, the mechanism of infection is such that they only attack the upper airways.

The SARS-CoV-2 is totally different.  It attaches to the ACE2 surface receptor which is found deep in aleolar pneumocytes.  Their damage causes loss of surfactant in the alveloi, the collapse of these air cells that perform oxygen exchange and subsequently ARDS.

So, seasonal coronaviruses give you a runny nose but don't kill.  SARS-Cov-2 collapses your air cells so you don't have any oxygen.

There have been other serious threats before for which the containment strategy proved sufficient, and if a government allocates resources (for instance massive purchases of masks and ventilators) which end up wasted they are going to be criticized as well. 

This article in the Guardian argues that most European countries were not as well prepared as some Asian countries because:


There was no recent experience of a serious epidemic in the country,
causing leaders to subconsciously underestimate the seriousness of
the threat.
There is a potential political cost for a government if they invest
resources by precaution and the risk doesn't materialize:


  ""The challenge faced by government is whether and when to act on a health threat. If you act swiftly and the outbreak isn’t as bad as
  feared, then government gets criticised for overreacting. If you
  adopt a wait-and-see approach and move too slowly, then government
  gets criticised for underreacting,"" says Steve Taylor, professor at
  the University of British Columbia and author of The Psychology of
  Pandemics.


As an example, during the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic
Roselyne Bachelot was Minister of Health in the French
government. She purchased 94 million vaccines, but only a small
proportion turned out to be actually used. As a result she was
widely criticized for wasting public money. I assume that there are
other examples of this kind, where a politician loses some political
points because they made a safe but costly decision.


It seems that when an epidemic threat presents itself a government must make a call between:


Taking the threat seriously and therefore mobilizing important resources for an overall unlikely epidemic crisis, with a high risk to appear as overreacting and wasting public money.
Taking minimal conservative measures, which is unlikely to be sufficient if the crisis materializes. However this will likely appear as the ""normal"" choice to make, since nobody could objectively have anticipated the intensity of the crisis.

","Can someone die of the common cold?

No. 
The common cold is a clinical syndrome restricted to upper respiratory tract involvement. By clinical syndrome, I mean it is the constellation of symptoms (rather than the consequence of a specific pathogen). As you mention, these symptoms are the result of the immune response, rather than tissue damage or compromised function as a direct effect of a pathogen or its toxin (e.g., the watery diarrhea in cholera).  

As defined (see, e.g., Cecil Medicine Ch. 369), this clinical syndrome cannot lead to death. 


  The common cold is an upper respiratory syndrome of rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction, frequently accompanied by sore throat, sneezing, and cough.


Can the viruses that cause the common cold cause death?

Yes. Many viruses that cause the common cold also cause other clinical syndromes that can cause death. This occurs when viral replication moves to the lower respiratory tract. As an example, influenza viruses are responsible for 25 - 30% of common colds (see Bennett, Principles and Practice of Infectious Disease, Ch.58). When it moves beyond the upper respiratory tract, influenza is responsible for substantial mortality. Other virus families that are responsible for both a common cold syndrome and lower respiratory tract syndrome in immunocompetent individuals (e.g., bronchiolitis, pneumonia) include parainfluenza virus, metapneumovirus, adenovirus, and (rarely) coronavirus. Rhinovirus, responsible for 40-50% of common cold cases, is uniquely unsuited to lower respiratory tract involvement, because of its preference for the cooler environment of the nasal mucosa, replicating best at 33 C (Murray Medical Microbiology, Ch 56). However, in individuals with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), lower respiratory tract involvement does occur. There are a number of case series reporting death due to lower respiratory rhinovirus. This is an example.

Can the common cold lead to serious illnesses other than lower respiratory tract involvement?

Yes. Other morbidity can occur as a result of the immune response that produces the common cold syndrome. Rhinorrhea and congestion can progress to a viral rhinosinusitis, a separate syndrome with its own complications, or a secondary bacterial infection, which can lead to bacterial sinus involvement and/or bacterial lower respiratory tract infection. Otitis media is another common complication, especially in children, and has its own potential complications. Asthma (and, generally speaking, most lung diseases) can also be exacerbated by what would otherwise be a simple common cold and predisposes to lower respiratory tract involvement. Asthma does deserve special mention, because rhinovirus associated exacerbations can be fatal, but this is a consequence of asthma rather than a common cold syndrome. Further discussion of these syndromes are beyond the scope of the question, but are discussed briefly in the chapters referenced above.

Upper respiratory tract infections (URI) can be caused by multiple virus families such as the rhinovirus (the most common cause of URI), the influenza virus, the coronavirus and the adenovirus.

While most of the URI share similar manifestations like rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, cough and sore throat, some symptoms may be much likely associated with a specific type of virus: myalgia and fatigue are commonly seen in influenza and parainfluenza infections, while conjunctivitis are often linked to adenovirus infection.

In general cases, URI are self limited diseases. However, some patients (children aged less than 1 year and adults aged more than 65 years, pregnant woman, and people of any age with comorbid illnesses) are at risk of developing complications. Pulmonary complications are the most frequent complications of influenza infection and are often associated with secondary bacterial infection that can lead to acute lung injury. The latter is associated with high mortality rate. Neuromuscular and cardiovascular complications are less common.

2,5,Why won't the Federal Reserve's 2020 quantitative easing cause hyperinflation like in 1921-1923 Weimar Republic?,"Some people (bulls), believe that the initial dip was an over-reaction, that the government response will prevent further decline, and/or that things will go back to normal pretty quickly, so they are buying the dip. On the other side you have people (bears) that believe the initial reaction was just a start but not enough to price-in the full impact, that the government can't prop up the economy, and/or that this will drag on for a long while, so they are betting on further decline. The problem with this idea of information being priced-in is that we all know there's a global pandemic, but there are very different opinions about how much that should affect the market. The fact that you have a choice to claim her as your dependent or not, implies that she can be claimed by you as a dependent. In that case, she cannot get the stimulus payment, even if you do not actually claim her as a dependent on your tax return. Cashier and teller operations of banks, including ATMs, falls under the essential category list. All essential services, including internet and courier services, will continue to function. However, that typically applies to natural disasters, and not a pandemic like COVID-19. Experts say that, unless there's a special clause in your Enterprise Agreement, employers may be able to stand employees down without pay. This will vary with each employer, so it's best to check with them. For casual workers and independent contractors, including gig economy workers, the situation is potentially more grim. Under the plan, individuals who earn $75,000 in adjusted gross income or less would get direct payments of $1,200 each. But which tax return is that based on? If you've filed for 2019, that's what it would based off of. If you haven't, it would be based off of 2018. Salary, wages, commission (not to exceed $100,000) Cash tips or equivalent Vacation, parental, family, medical or sick leave Severance or separation pay and any retirement benefit Group health care benefit pay including insurance premiums State and local tax on the compensation of employees. The United States has moved the federal tax-filing deadline to July 15, giving Americans an additional three months to file their income tax returns. Some states are also making changes. A coronavirus emergency relief package, passed by Congress in mid-March, gives qualified workers two weeks of paid sick leave if they are ill, quarantined or seeking a diagnosis or preventive care for the coronavirus, or if they are caring for sick family members. It gives 12 weeks of paid leave to people caring for children whose schools are closed or whose child care provider is unavailable because of the coronavirus. A recent study found that the virus disintegrates over about 24 hours on cardboard, suggesting that packages may have only low levels of the virus — unless the delivery person has coughed or sneezed on it or has handled it with contaminated hands. If you are concerned about the risk, wipe down packages with disinfectant wipes and wash your hands. The legislation would send direct payments of $1,200 to millions of Americans, including those earning up to $75,000, and an additional $500 per child. It expands jobless aid, providing an additional 13 weeks and a four-month enhancement of benefits, and extends the payments for the first time to freelancers and gig workers. The money is not counted as taxable income. It’s treated as a fully refundable tax credit against your 2020 taxes, meaning that you get the money even if you don’t have any tax liability.

Tax experts said that they think it would be helpful for the IRS to provide guidance for taxpayers who have moved or have new bank accounts since they filed their most recent tax return. Under the bill, the IRS has to send a notice to a taxpayer’s last known address within 15 days of distributing a payment. The notice should provide information about the payment amount, the method used to make the payment and an IRS phone number to report failures to receive the payment. A Republican aide to the Senate Finance Committee noted in a call with reporters Wednesday that Green Card holders qualify for work-eligible Social Security numbers.

People are laid off all the time when sales are down, the market is bad, etc: there is no legal ""right to a job"" except whatever is in your employment contract.

Theoretically, you could file for eviction against your tenant and at some point the petition could be granted, and the sheriff would enforce it. Those are the current legal options. Current (optimistic) projections are that evictions could happen in the second half of May. There has been zero talk about cutting social security payments to people currently receiving payments.","If you want something ""even more ELI5"", try this from the Atlantic:


  Let me unpack these one by one. Right now getting the markets to buy our debt isn't the problem. Getting enough debt for the markets to buy is the problem. Investors are so crazy to load up on Treasuries that they're actually paying us to borrow, taking inflation into account. But while we're currently getting free money from investors, Hungary circa 1945 was getting no money. It was an investment pariah. If Hungary wanted to rebuild its economy, its only recourse was the printing press.    
  
  Second, the United States isn't really printing money. At least not like post-war Hungary. Quantitative easing is usually described as ""money-printing"" but it's not really. QE involves the Fed buying longer-term bonds from banks. It simply swaps one asset for another -- in this case, cash for longer-term bonds. Unlike Hungary, the Fed isn't directly paying the Treasury's bills. This is a hugely important distinction.
  
  Whatever money the Fed ""prints"" is stuck in the banks. That money isn't inflationary as long as the banks don't lend it out. What if the banks do start lending at a faster clip? The Fed can still effectively pay the banks not lend by, for example, raising the interest on excess reserves or require the banks to set aside more money. It would be shocking for the Fed not to pursue one of these options.
  
  Third, the most important difference between us and post-war Hungary or Weimar is that our roads haven't been razed to the ground and half the country isn't striking. It's very difficult to have hyperinflation when you still have a functioning economy. Almost all examples of hyperinflation result from huge economic shocks that devastate an economy so much that leaders think printing money is the only solution to growth. As bad as the Great Recession has been, our GDP is already back to and above its all-time pre-recession high. As bad as unemployment is, more than 80 percent of the labor force is working. In Zimbabwe, 80 percent of the population was unemployed.
  
  Let's conclude with a modest proposal for an economic corollary to Godwin's Law. The first person to reference Weimar's hyperinflation in an economic debate automatically loses.


Yeah, it was written in 2012... Nowadays there are some fears (time will tell if justified) that people returning from the lockdowns [when those end] will cause ""unexpected"" inflation. But that's a different story, not really about QE.

And if you want more recent data on where US inflation is headed, ""this just in"":


  U.S. consumer prices fell by the most in more than five years in March and further decreases  are likely as the novel coronavirus outbreak suppresses demand for some goods and services, offsetting price increases related to shortages resulting from disruptions to the supply chain.
  
  The Labor Department said on Friday its consumer price index dropped 0.4% last month amid a tumble in the costs of gasoline, hotel accommodation, apparel and airline tickets. That was the biggest drop since January 2015 and followed a 0.1% gain in February. 
  
  The general price level decline is expected even as the Federal Reserve has adopted extraordinary measures to stop the economy’s free-fall. [...]
  
  “The disinflationary impulse, along with the great disruption in economic and financial market activity, is a key reason why the Fed is unleashing vast new monetary policy stimulus,” said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. [...]
  
  Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI dipped 0.1% in March, the first drop since January 2010.

We don't know the full impact of our current situation; we're feeling it out.


Some people (bulls), believe that the initial dip was an over-reaction, that the government response will prevent further decline, and/or that things will go back to normal pretty quickly, so they are buying the dip.

The problem with this idea of information being priced-in is that we all know there's a global pandemic, but there are very different opinions about how much that should affect the market.

Consider unemployment levels: We have projections about unemployment rate potentially hitting a peak over 30%. Meanwhile, the current unemployment rate is 4.4% and projected to hit double digits in April. The only way all of that information could be appropriately priced in is if everyone agreed about the reasonableness of the projections and had the economic prowess to understand the actual impact of those figures.

Instead, what happens is that some people will see the actual April unemployment numbers as surprising new information to react to, while others will see it as old information in line with their expectations. Add in thousands of other pieces of information about which people have conflicting opinions, and it becomes pretty much impossible to know in advance if that information was all priced in appropriately.

The most recent comparable event is the subprime mortgage crash. Many people thought bottom was hit around November 2008 and there was a brief counter-trend rally before actual bottom was hit around March 2009. We don't know at this time if the market has bottomed out yet or not; nor do we know how long recovery could take.

The Chinese Government seems to manage the stock market directly at times. I.e. There are stories (like the one above) where the governments doesn't allow funds or brokers to sell. That level of control likely wouldn't happen in the USA. 
Maybe their Central Bank stepped in more quickly/strongly. Although I suspect a larger part of your answer is in #1 above, than #2 here.

Usually, if you are asked by your employer not to work (assuming you're a full-time or part-time employee), you would be entitled to be paid.
However, that typically applies to natural disasters, and not a pandemic like COVID-19.
Experts say that, unless there's a special clause in your Enterprise Agreement, employers may be able to stand employees down without pay.
This will vary with each employer, so it's best to check with them.
For casual workers and independent contractors, including gig economy workers, the situation is potentially more grim.
According to Fair Work, if you're a casual employee needing to look after a family member who is sick with coronavirus, or suffering an unexpected emergency, you are entitled to just two days of unpaid carer's leave per occasion.
After that, you'll need to contact your employer to work out an arrangement.
Casual employees and independent contractors may qualify for the sickness allowance, a means-tested payment that provides up to $560 for singles without children and $1,010 for couples out of work due to illness.
The Government has waived the one-week waiting period to access the allowance.
The Federal Government has increased existing payments for welfare allowances, and expanding eligibility criteria for new applicants, for six months to late September.

In its most recent guidance, the SBA clarified that while income of sole proprietors and independent contractors count as payroll, payments to independent contractors do not count: “independent contractors have the ability to apply for a PPP loan on their own so they do not count for purposes of a borrower’s PPP loan calculation.”

For people who have not filed a 2018 or 2019 tax return and do not receive Social Security or railroad retirement benefits, there is an incentive to promptly file a tax return to ensure that the IRS can reach them to distribute the money to them this year. 

People who do not file tax returns are typically low-income. For example, the IRS requires married couples with both spouses under 65 to file returns for 2019 if their gross income was at least $24,400. That threshold is raised to $27,000 in cases where both spouses were 65 or older. Social Security benefits often aren’t included in gross income."

Normally, the employer can argue that they have the right to fire you regardless of performance, and that would be the end of it. Let's say you have it in writing, and it is clear that they unconditionally promise to hire you back: you would want to (e)stop them from arguing that they have the right to fire you. The underlying idea of promissory estoppel is that such a promise keeps them from making that argument. But: it is not enough that they made the promise, you also had to rely on the promise and act / forbear from acting in some way because of that promise. It could be, for example, taking another job, or moving to another country, or simply looking for another job. The hard part, then, would be getting a clear and definite promise.

There has been talk about cutting the taxes funding the social security system. The idea would be to make up the shortfall due to a tax cut by sending money from the general fund into the social security system. That plan has problems due to unemployed people not having to pay into the social security system, so a tax cut wouldn't put money into their pocket. They might need money to pay rent and buy food.

Unfortunately, there is no great answer.  It's sort of like asking if stocks are going to go up or down.  I'll list here the three big things that will determine the value of the USD in the medium term.  There are many others but I believe these to be the big ones.

(1) The decrease in economic activity as a result of the coronavirus should be strongly deflationary.  This can increase the amount of stuff that a dollar can buy because there isn't as much demand for the stuff.  So effectively the dollar strengthens.

(2) A flight to safety during time of stress where the USD is generally considered the safest currency.  The dollar has generally been strengthening against other currencies.  Part of this strengthening has been related though to the fact that a lot of borrowing happens in USD and when you borrow USD and then lose money you have to pay back the USD that you lost.  This has meant dollar buying, which has certainly contributed to the recent dollar strength.

(3) Stimulus/relief efforts on the part of the federal gov't to counteract the economic effects of the virus mean more debt to GDP.  Giving people money to spend like this in inflationary, which should reduce the value of the dollar.  The more debt you have relative to your ability to pay, then the more those lending to you should theoretically charge you in interest because you are a riskier borrower and less likely to make good on all of your payments. 

So we have two deflationary effects and one large inflationary effect.  The depth and length of the crisis will determine how much dollar ""strength""* we see from #1 and #2, and the gov't response to the depth and breadth of the crisis will determine #3.  They're intertwined.

*Here strength is relative to the price of goods and used in the deflationary sense of strength.

  Today the Fed announced a $1.5 trillion liquidity provision to the interbank lending market — primarily in the form of “repurchase agreements.” The interbank lending market comprises the federal-funds market (in which the Fed actively participates on a daily basis) and the repurchase-agreement (or “repo”) market (in which the Fed intervenes primarily when there is a lack of liquidity). In the repo market, one financial institution temporarily trades securities to another institution, with the understanding that it will repurchase those securities in the near future (usually the next day). Banks with large balance sheets often need access to quick cash to conduct regular operations, and the most practical way to get that cash is through repos. Otherwise, managing their balance sheets would be needlessly onerous.

Broader viral testing might be needed."" Coronavirus can also affect your nose and throat, your blood, and maybe your stomach and intestines too. In kids, the virus is most likely to affect your nose and throat. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention. With so much advice telling people to stay home, it can be hard to know when emergency treatment is necessary. The World Health Organisation (WHO) says about 80 per cent of people recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Growing evidence suggests that loss of smell and taste are also symptoms of having the coronavirus. At the moment, it appears someone who is infected can show symptoms as early as two days later and as long as 14 days after they have been infected, based on past coronavirus outbreaks like MERS and SARS. If you experience flu like symptoms, it is best to consult a local doctor. Do not head to the hospital straightaway as it can expose you to the infection.

In addition, there have been a rapidly growing number of reports of a significant increase in the number of patients presenting with anosmia in the absence of other symptoms – this has been widely shared on medical discussion boards by surgeons from all regions managing a high incidence of cases. While there is a chance the apparent increase in incidence could merely reflect the attention COVID-19 has attracted in the media, and that such cases may be caused by typical rhinovirus and coronavirus strains, it could potentially be used as a screening tool to help identify otherwise asymptomatic patients, who could then be better instructed on self-isolation. Given the potential for COVID-19 to present with anosmia, and the reports that corticosteroid use may increase the severity of infection, we would advise against use of oral steroids in the treatment of new onset anosmia during the pandemic, particularly if it is unrelated to head trauma or nasal pathology (such as nasal polyps).

While there is a chance the apparent increase in incidence could merely reflect the attention COVID-19 has attracted in the media, and that such cases may be caused by typical rhinovirus and coronavirus strains, it could potentially be used as a screening tool to help identify otherwise asymptomatic patients, who could then be better instructed on self-isolation. Given the potential for COVID-19 to present with anosmia, and the reports that corticosteroid use may increase the severity of infection, we would advise against use of oral steroids in the treatment of new onset anosmia during the pandemic, particularly if it is unrelated to head trauma or nasal pathology (such as nasal polyps). There is potential that if any adult with anosmia but no other symptoms was asked to self-isolate for seven days, in addition to the current symptom criteria used to trigger quarantine, we might be able to reduce the number of otherwise asymptomatic individuals who continue to act as vectors, not realising the need to self-isolate.

Most people get fever and cough, sometimes fatigue or shortness of breath, and recover after about two weeks. About 15% develop severe disease, including pneumonia, Chinese scientists reported from 45,000 cases there. Symptoms usually start slowly and often worsen as the illness goes on. In a report last week on the first 12 patients in the US, seven were hospitalized; most had underlying health problems and got worse during the second week of illness. In China, slightly more males have been diagnosed with COVID-19 than females, which might be because roughly half of Chinese men smoke but only 5% of females do, Frieden said.

 “The viral load — the amount of virus – does determine the severity of your illness,” emergency room physician Dr. Leana Wen said. “So that could happen in the case of health care workers who are exposed to a lot more Covid-19 as a result of their work — that they get more severely ill.”"
3,13,What percentage of otherwise asymptomatic covid-19 cases are presenting just with anosmia?,"The 69-year-old man in Wuhan had both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus. Doctors initially diagnosed the man with the flu and later diagnosed the coronavirus. Doctors studying the patient said the case ""suggests that COVID-19 might be underdiagnosed because of false-negative tests for upper respiratory specimens or co-infection with other respiratory viruses. Broader viral testing might be needed."" Coronavirus can also affect your nose and throat, your blood, and maybe your stomach and intestines too. In kids, the virus is most likely to affect your nose and throat. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention. With so much advice telling people to stay home, it can be hard to know when emergency treatment is necessary. The World Health Organisation (WHO) says about 80 per cent of people recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Growing evidence suggests that loss of smell and taste are also symptoms of having the coronavirus. At the moment, it appears someone who is infected can show symptoms as early as two days later and as long as 14 days after they have been infected, based on past coronavirus outbreaks like MERS and SARS. If you experience flu like symptoms, it is best to consult a local doctor. Do not head to the hospital straightaway as it can expose you to the infection. Many health care workers don’t actually have enough protective gear to handle the growing influx of coronavirus patients. Some have resorted to using plastic report covers as masks. The CDC said medical providers might have to use expired masks or reuse them between multiple patients. In South Korea, where testing has been more widespread, 30% of patients testing positive have had anosmia as their major presenting symptom in otherwise mild cases. In addition, there have been a rapidly growing number of reports of a significant increase in the number of patients presenting with anosmia in the absence of other symptoms – this has been widely shared on medical discussion boards by surgeons from all regions managing a high incidence of cases. While there is a chance the apparent increase in incidence could merely reflect the attention COVID-19 has attracted in the media, and that such cases may be caused by typical rhinovirus and coronavirus strains, it could potentially be used as a screening tool to help identify otherwise asymptomatic patients, who could then be better instructed on self-isolation. Given the potential for COVID-19 to present with anosmia, and the reports that corticosteroid use may increase the severity of infection, we would advise against use of oral steroids in the treatment of new onset anosmia during the pandemic, particularly if it is unrelated to head trauma or nasal pathology (such as nasal polyps). There is potential that if any adult with anosmia but no other symptoms was asked to self-isolate for seven days, in addition to the current symptom criteria used to trigger quarantine, we might be able to reduce the number of otherwise asymptomatic individuals who continue to act as vectors, not realising the need to self-isolate. It will also be an important trigger for healthcare personnel to employ full PPE and help to counter the higher rates of infection found amongst ENT surgeons compared to other healthcare workers. Many people have. While the risk for serious disease and death from COVID-19 is higher in people who are older or who have certain preexisting conditions, thousands have survived. Data from the CDC published Tuesday found that, as of March 28, the U.S.reported 2,692 patients who had one or more underlying health conditions. Of those patients, 173 died. This limited data suggests that thousands of people who have one or more underlying health conditions have not died.","This situation has not been fully characterised yet and has not been reported in the cases as a significant presentation before.  But ENT UK has issued the following advisory and hopes to stall the inappropriate use of steroids for anosmia


  There is already good evidence from South Korea, China and Italy that significant numbers of patients with proven COVID-19 infection have developed anosmia/hyposmia. In Germany it is reported that more than 2 in 3 confirmed cases have anosmia. In South Korea, where testing has been more widespread, 30% of patients testing positive have had anosmia as their major presenting symptom in otherwise mild cases. 
  
  In addition, there have been a rapidly growing number of reports of a significant increase in the number of patients presenting with anosmia in the absence of other symptoms – this has been widely shared on medical discussion boards by surgeons from all regions managing a high incidence of cases. Iran has reported a sudden increase in cases of isolated anosmia, and many colleagues from the US, France and Northern Italy have the same experience. I have personally seen four patients this week, all under 40, and otherwise asymptomatic except for the recent onset of anosmia – I usually see roughly no more than one a month. I think these patients may be some of the hitherto hidden carriers that have facilitated the rapid spread of COVID-19. Unfortunately, these patients do not meet current criteria for testing or self-isolation.

4,15,How can caregivers protect themselves while helping someone with COVID-19 at home?,"For people who are caring for a person who has been diagnosed with COVID-19, the Public Health Agency of Canada has a number of tips on how they can protect themselves while they provide care. If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home, you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms, while also keeping as much distance as possible, according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. in February. If there’s space, the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom to minimize contact with healthy family members. Any shared spaces should have good airflow, such as an open window or an air conditioner, and you shouldn’t allow any visitors except for those who need to be in the house. Your family member should wear a face mask when he or she is around others, and if he or she can’t because of difficulty breathing, you should wear a mask.  Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items with your sick family member and to regularly clean surfaces like counters, doorknobs, toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. If you show symptoms, get tested. If you have been in contact with a person with a COVID-19 infection while they were ill, you need to isolate yourself for 14 days after you last saw that person. The general aim of physical distancing rules is to avoid situations where you may come in close contact with others (face-to-face contact closer than one metre for more than 15 minutes or being in the same closed space for two hours).
If you live with your partner, they count as being part of your household. If neither of you is showing coronavirus symptoms and you are already in close contact, having sex won't increase the likelihood of you catching the virus from one another. If one person does have symptoms, they should be self-isolating in a separate room. Using contraception such as condoms won't alter your risk of catching the virus, as having sex will bring you into close physical contact anyway. If you have any travel insurance or other general insurance, you may want to look at whether it would cover any losses you incur.  Again, I wouldn't hold my breath, but it's better to check now rather than to find out after the claim deadline has passed that you might have been eligible for reimbursement.  
In all honesty, it is probably a better idea to stay put in one place. If the local laws allow it, you can still go cycling and return to your home each night. So it seems that he did everything required and the city administration can't keep up. ","For people who are caring for a person who has been diagnosed with COVID-19,
the Public Health Agency of Canada has a number of tips on how they can
protect themselves while they provide care.

According to PHAC, only one healthy person should provide care to the
individual with COVID-19, and that person should limit their contact with them
as much as possible. They should also not share personal items with them, such
as toothbrushes, towels, bed linen, utensils or electronic devices. The ill
person should have their own bathroom, if possible. If not, they should put
the toilet lid down every time before flushing.

Caregivers should wear a mask, disposable gloves, and eye protection when
they’re in close proximity to the patient and never reuse the mask or gloves.
They should also frequently wash their hands with soap and water, especially
after contact with the sick individual.

What’s more, caregivers should remain vigilant about monitoring themselves for
symptoms for 14 days."

you are a data controller established/living in the UK or are offering services to people in the UK
you fall under the material scope of the GDPR. The Art 2(2)(c) exemption for “purely personal or household activity” does not apply since you're offering the service to the public.


You must consider GDPR compliance here. This is especially important as you are showing personal data to the public. Don't do that unless you have a very good reason, appropriate safeguards, and are clear to users how their information will be shown.

On a high level, GDPR compliance involves working on the following questions:


For what purpose are you processing personal data?

Context: purpose limitation principle per GDPR Art 5(1)(b)
What is the legal basis for processing?

GDPR Art 6(1) lists the available legal bases. Here, consent, necessity for performance of a contract, or a legitimate interest could be a legal basis. They may have further obligations attached. A legitimate interest requires a balancing test that considers the data subject's rights and freedoms. Consent must fulfil the conditions per Art 7 in order to be valid.
What is the minimal data necessary to achieve the purpose?

Per the Art 5(1)(c) data minimisation principle, it is illegal to process personal data beyond what is necessary and adequate. You must provide data protection by design and by default per Art 25. Special categories of data per Art 9 such as health data are illegal to process outside of narrow exemptions. You must delete data once it is no longer necessary.
What appropriate safeguards and security measures should you apply?

Per Art 24 and 25, you are responsible for determining and implementing appropriate measures. This depends a lot on your specific context, so there's no checklist you can apply. Per Art 25(1) you must pseudonymize the processed information if that is compatible with the processing purpose.
What further compliance measures do you have to consider?

There are additional GDPR and non-GDPR compliance measures. From the GDPR side:


Use the answers to these questions to write a privacy policy, including the information that you must provide to data subjects per Art 13.
Consider whether you have to maintain a Records of Processing document per Art 30, or if you have to make a Data Protection Impact Assessment per Art 35. 
If you use third party services, figure out whether they are a joint controller or data processor and apply appropriate safeguards.

Any shared spaces should have good airflow, such as an open window or an air conditioner, and you shouldn’t allow any visitors except for those who need to be in the house. Your family member should wear a face mask when he or she is around others, and if he or she can’t because of difficulty breathing, you should wear a mask.  Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items with your sick family member and to regularly clean surfaces like counters, doorknobs, toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently. If you show symptoms, get tested.

It means that you don't get it back.

That might seem an irrelevant difference, but often it is not - you can use the value of the ticket for further bookings with the airline (for the same flier, not just anybody).
If you cancel the ticket, you typically have 365 days (from day of payment, not day of flight) to use the value for another booking.

The no-show fee is a fee that gets taken out of your remaining value - if the flier simply doesn't show up (instead of cancelling), he will not get the full ticket value parked, but it will be reduced by the no-show fee.
So you should definitely cancel, as it will save the no-show fee. Only if the person is not going to fly within a full year is the ticket value completely lost.

You can cancel the insurance at any time before the coverage begins.  The company website says


  Before the beginning of coverage, ... you can request a full refund at any time. 


Visa application fee

Your visa fee is probably lost, but you might try asking if you can adjust your application dates.  I wouldn't hold my breath.

Air fare

Rebooking

Subject to some conditions, you can probably rebook the air tickets without change fees:


  SWISS will waive its rebooking fees for all newly booked flights worldwide with immediate effect and until March 31 and offer a one-off free rebooking. For existing bookings, the new waiver policy will apply worldwide to all flights booked by March 5 with a departure date up to April 30, 2020. Passengers will thus be able to rebook their flight ticket once to a new date up to December 31, 2020 without incurring any rebooking fee.


As noted by Mark Johnson in a comment, this policy applies to the entire Lufthansa Group.

Refund

If you're lucky enough that your flight is cancelled, however, you might get a refund:


  For cancelled flights: If you have booked through swiss.com or a Service Centre and you don't want to rebook your flight ticket, you can refund your ticket. To do so, please complete the refund form.
  
  If you booked through an (online) travel agency, please contact the travel agency.


I say ""might"" because I don't know whether you'd be able to get a refund if the flight is cancelled after you rebook it.

Taxes and fees

Even if you cannot recover your airfare, you should be entitled to a refund of certain taxes and fees for flights that you didn't actually take.

So it seems that he did everything required and the city administration can't keep up. ","TL;DR: You can, possibly, in some places, but it may not be a great idea.

Whether it is legal depends on the Bundesland (state) — to put it simply, the federal government has no authority in these matters, and each state put down their own rules. There are federal rules for entry into Germany, but these don't apply as you are already in the country.

Example rules

For example: In Saarland they implemented a lockdown (possibly due to their proximity to the heavy-hit regions of France): You may only leave your home due to ""important reasons"". On the other hand Rheinland-Pfalz has a ""contact prohibition"", which means that you can free to go wherever you want, as long as you are with no more than one other person. 

Also, individual cities have the right to be more restrictive.

Things change

Case numbers will rise in Germany and regulations may become more strict at any moment. In which case it may be difficult for you to go back home (also: Do not count on any restrictions being lifted until well after Easter — at best)

Infrastructure is shut down

However, even in Rheinland-Pfalz accommodations are not open for touristic purposes. This will include campgrounds. ""Wild"" camping is only regulated by the Länder, but generally there will be restrictions, and camping spots may be cordoned off. 

Also, most public services that are useful for travellers are also shut down.

Enforcement

It is difficult to say how things will be enforced. Generally there's no formal requirements in Germany, unlike in Italy or France. They will still stop and fine you if you blatantly flout the rules. My guess is that nobody will go and check for wild camping in the middle of nowhere, but they may check popular camping spots to make sure people don't congregate there.

Responsibility

Cycling alone is not really an (additional) risk, as long as you don't meet people. However, the question is if it is going to be a fun trip if you


can't go in places like the Saarland,
keep to yourself all the time,
have to find a remote spot to pitch your tent each night, and have no access to sanitary facilities,
have to bring/buy and cook your own food (there will be no restaurants).


Plus, Germany is a densely populated country — it will be hard to really be alone. And as soon as more than one person pitches their tent in one place, the police will likely see that as a ""congregation"" and break it up. 

In all honesty, it is probably a better idea to stay put in one place. If the local laws allow it, you can still go cycling and return to your home each night.

They try to move the bookings, so that they have the money (liquidity) to pay employers. They could be in trouble if all clients will ask refund (there could ask government for help).

But you booking is a contract, so they are required to fulfill the contract on the data you both agreed, or they must refund you.  Just they try (maybe with a better offer) to keep booking (and money) for a later period.

The website booking.com doesn't get money from you (you will pay the hotel), so they have no really interest to have the ""move booking"" default.

So try to contact them, and think: do you want to book in a later date? In that case you may try to get a very good offer. But they must refund you.

The last step, it is to contact your credit card, and get the money back from them, because you were charged a service they will not offer you.

  The extraction of RNA in molecular biology experiments is greatly complicated by the presence of ubiquitous and hardy ribonucleases that degrade RNA samples. Certain RNases can be extremely hardy and inactivating them is difficult compared to neutralizing DNases. In addition to the cellular RNases that are released, there are several RNases that are present in the environment. RNases have evolved to have many extracellular functions in various organisms.

When you see colored pictures of them, that’s because scientists have actually added color so you can see the parts of the coronavirus more clearly. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19. Some parts of viruses are consistently shaped, in particular anything that is made of multiple copies of a protein sticking together. There are methods to determine the structures of these regular components to high precision, like single particle analysis (eg. zika) and X-ray crystallography (bacteriophage HK97). Other parts of the virus are less consistent, either because they are flexible or because they are produced slightly differently each time. The nucleic acid core is often arranged semi-randomly, and the lipid envelope of many viruses can vary greatly, dependent on the process by which parts of the host cell's membrane is pinched off to create new viral particles. Here's an example of pretty extreme variability of influenza particles, based on what cell type they have infected.

Yes, it is routine practice to use microfiltration in labs to sterilize solutions from microbes. 0.2 micron filters will remove all typically-found bacteria most of the time, except for the odd bacteria here and there, though this is uncommon. 0.1 micron filters certainly remove all stray bacteria that may make it through upon a single 0.2 micrometer filtration. Here is a nice read on the appropriateness of 0.2 and 0.1 microfilters, which simply states that 0.2 micro filters are usually more appropriate since they additionally guarantee a better flow rate.

The aforementioned filter will NOT ensure filtration of viruses

These filters are not used, suitable nor effective for viruses, however. You ask specifically about the coronavirus. From a 2015 study:


  Coronaviruses are members of the Coronaviridae group and contain a
  single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome surrounded by a corona-like
  helical envelope (Ryan 1994). The SARS virus genome consists of 29,751
  base pairs. Approximately 41% of the genome is GC base pairs while 59%
  is TA base pairs. Coronaviruses have a size range of 0.08-0.15
  microns; with a mean size of 0.11 microns (see Figure 1).


This means 0.1 micron filters will not protect you from these viruses. They may help you reduce viral count in the air, which may of course be sufficient, but this would not be an adequate measure in a biological safety facility.

The cost-effectiveness of commercial air-purifiers for biosafety vs. pollution

On a advice-related note: I do not think air-purifiers are going to help you in a cost-effective manner to avoid viruses (e.g. Rhinoviruses that cause the common cold, for instance), lest you stay at home all the time. You expose yourself outdoors, and carry plenty of viruses indoors on your body and in your respiratory tract; these will bypass your filtration system on the daily. Being healthy and lucky enough to avoid exposure to viruses outside the house is still the best bet. I think an air purifier has a greater potential to help with smog and urban pollution, those particles are typically larger than the diameter of most microbes.

It can be detected on surfaces after hours via PCR, however PCR is as sensitive to broken down pieces of a virus particle as it is to the fresh, contagious specimen.

It should be noted that there are many non-pathogenic causes of sore throat, and I would suspect that you are not always distinguishing these causes from actual illness.


In most cases, it would not be possible to build a response (immunological or otherwise) to avoid reacting to these stressors. 

Bacteria and viruses mutate frequently in ways that make your immune system unable to properly recognize them to ward off initial infection.


Your immune system recognizes specific pathogens based on structural characteristics. If those characteristics change when pathogens mutate (which happens fairly frequently), your immune system will not recognize it as readily (or initially at all).  



 Long Answer 

Sore throat is most commonly attributed to pharyngitis, or the inflammation of the back of the throat called the pharynx.

Causes

Sore throats can be caused by many things. (e.g., see here, summarized below):

First off, a sore throat can be the result of many things unrelated to illness: 


Allergies
Dryness
Irritants
Excessive talking,singing,shouting,etc.
Muscle Strain
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)


As a result, at least 30+% (higher in adults) of reported sore throat cases (and supposedly many more unreported cases) are not due to any type of illness. 

Further, a number of pathogens can cause a sore throat:


Viruses


Rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza, parainfluenza, adenoviruses, Epstein–Barr, etc.
(see here for one estimate of relative etiologies). 

Bacteria


A number of bacterial infections can cause a sore throat. The most common is Streptococcus pyogenes (aka ""Strep A""). 



It turns out that pathogen-caused pharyngitis is fairly common. Supposedly 10% of adults with sore throats have strep, and around 70% of children pharyngitis cases seen by doctors are either virally or bacterially caused.  


However, it should be noted that only 20-30% of children and just 5-10% of adults have bacteria to blame for their sore throat, with viral infections being much more common. (source: IDSA).


Sore Throat Frequency

It turns out that sore throats are fairly common; Jones (2004) determined that about 7.5% of people have a sore throat in any three-month period. Further, on average, adults get a sore throat two to three times a year and children about five times a year (Tamparo 2011 and Rutter &amp; Newby 2015), so your personal experience is fairly average.

Because viral causes and non-pathogenic causes make up an overwhelming percentage of overall sore throat cases, it shouldn't be surprising that most sore throats clear up without the use of any antibiotics. 

As for those that are caused by pathogens:

Why no Immunity?

Bacteria and viruses both mutate fairly quickly (see Antigenic Variation, Antigenic Drift and Antigenic Shift), so it shouldn't be surprising that you're capable of having an immune response to pathogens throughout life. 


If we consider just strep alone, it mutates/reemerges with improved fitness frequently (e.g., see Bao et al 2016 and their citations)
And see Sanjuán et al. (2010) for a reviewof viral mutation rates. 


So not only are there a number of pathogens that can cause sore throat, but each of these pathogens can mutate. That leaves you with a fairly sizable number of potential invaders that can illicit a sore throat. 

Let's See How Your Immune System Responds:

Your immune system contains cells that can be split into two broad groups: cells that belong to the adaptive immune system, and cells which belong to the innate immune system. [See here for a simple explanation].


Innate Immune system: consists of cells responsible for initial detection of pathogens, recruitment of other immune cells, activation of the complement system, engulfment and (more immediate) destruction of pathogens. 
Adaptive immune system: consists of cells which coordinate to develop a memory of the infections they've seen previously in order to mount a faster, more pronounced immune response to repeat pathogens.


Depending on the kind of foreign invasion, two different immune responses can occur in either of these 2 broader ""systems"": either a humoral response involving antibodies or a cell-mediated repsponse.



A general feature of the immune system is that these mechanisms rely on detecting structural features of the pathogen or toxin that mark it as distinct from host cells (see Chaplin 2010 for a review). The mechanisms permitting recognition of pathogenic/toxic foreign structures can be broken down into two general categories: 


hard-wired responses encoded by genes that recognize molecular patterns shared both by many microbes and toxins that are not present in the mammalian host. This is the innate system described above.
responses that are encoded by gene elements that somatically rearrange to assemble antigen-binding molecules with extreme specificity for individual unique foreign structures. This is the adaptive system described above.


Antibodies recognizes a unique/specific molecule of the harmful agent, called an antigen, and binds to it to tag it for immune attack.  





  Because the adaptive system is composed of small numbers of cells with specificity for any individual pathogen the responding cells must proliferate after encountering the antigen in order to attain sufficient numbers to mount an effective response against the microbe or the toxin. [Source: Chaplin 2010].



This means that you can still experience some mild symptoms due to the invading pathogen. 



The important take-away from all this, though, is that your immune response relies on structural ""markers"" on pathogens in order to recognize them. This is true for both innate and adaptive immune responses. If the physical/structural properties of a pathogen change (due to antigenic processes and mutations as mentioned above) your immune system will be slower (and possibly ineffective) in responding to an attack.  


The result, then, could be another one of those sore throats...

Now, the CDC “recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.”  The public should NOT buy surgical masks or N95 respirator masks. Instead, make your own cloth mask. US Surgeon General Jerome Adams shows how to make face masks with just a T-shirt and rubber bands in this CDC video.

Therefore, maintain social distancing, which means remaining 6 feet away from others.  Ideally, you shouldn't touch any surface on which droplets may have landed. The best way to protect yourself from exposed surfaces is to wash your hands frequently with soap and water for a count of 20. Self-isolate  only applies to those who have recently come back from overseas, or if you've been in contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. But if you are one of those people who has to self-isolate, it means that you should avoid all other public gatherings.

If you can, you should stay home from work when you’re sick, whether or not you have coronavirus. Many companies are increasingly flexible with work from home policies.

However, that is not necessary for SARS-CoV-2.  Any food you eat is going to be cooked for longer than a minute, and packaging can left for a couple of days for the virus to inactivate naturally.


  The standard recommendation for boiling water is a FULL ROLLING BOIL for ONE MINUTE and COOL BEFORE USE. The term rolling boil facilitates communication and assures that an effective pasteurization temperature is reached to kill or inactivate waterborne pathogens. Some agencies recommend boiling for longer periods, but this extra time is not necessary and can cause unnecessary power demand and increase safety concerns.


For cardboard boxes:


  On cardboard, no viable SARS-CoV-2 was measured after 24 hours


And on plastics/stainless steel


  SARS-CoV-2 was more stable on plastic and stainless steel than on copper and cardboard, and viable virus was detected up to 72 hours after application to these surfaces (Figure 1A), although the virus titer was greatly reduced (from 103.7 to 100.6 TCID50 per milliliter of medium after 72 hours on plastic and from 103.7 to 100.6 TCID50 per milliliter after 48 hours on stainless steel).


So, it can last for 72 hours at least though at greatly diminished amounts of viable virus.  So, use soap/water to wipe these surfaces down. Soap disrupts the virus capsule, and also forms a surfactant around the virus so it can be dislodged from surfaces. Some people do recommend you wash your vegetables of unknown provenance in soap and water.

There is no evidence of Covid-19 being transmitted through food, and thorough cooking will kill the virus. The UK Food Standards Agency website has advice on food safety.
If you aren't displaying coronavirus symptoms, make sure you wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before you start baking.
If you are showing symptoms of the virus - or have been in contact with someone who has - then it's probably not a good idea to prepare food for somebody else.
That's because coronavirus spreads through small droplets - packed with the virus - expelled by a sufferer if they cough or sneeze. These can cause an infection if they are breathed in, or if someone touches a surface on which they have landed.
While the chance of contracting coronavirus through food delivery is low, it does exist.
The tin or box the cake is placed in probably presents a higher risk than the cake itself, so your friend should rinse the packaging when she receives the cake.
If you're dropping the cake off yourself, you should maintain social distancing by ensuring you stay 2m (6ft) apart from each other."

  Warning - Level 3, Avoid Nonessential Travel—Widespread Community Transmission
  
  CDC recommends that travelers avoid all nonessential travel to Italy. There is limited access to adequate medical care in affected areas.  ... If you must travel:
  
  
  Avoid contact with sick people.
  Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
  Clean your hands often by washing them with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at 60%–95% alcohol. Soap and water should be used if hands are visibly dirty.
  
  
  It is especially important to clean hands after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing or blowing your nose.
  Supplies of hand sanitizer, tissues, and other hygiene products may be limited, so consider bringing them with you.
  
  Pay attention to your health during travel and for 14 days after you leave.
  


It is probably advisable to postpone travel to Italy at this time.

The main benefit of wearing masks in public isn’t to protect you from getting sick. As Covid-19 is spread through droplets, it can reach us through the air. Therefore, maintain social distancing, which means remaining 6 feet away from others.  Ideally, you shouldn't touch any surface on which droplets may have landed.

Such rapid development of a potential vaccine is unprecedented, and it was possible because researchers were able to use what they already knew about related coronaviruses that had caused other outbreaks, of SARS and MERS.  Other companies, using different approaches, are also trying to manufacture coronavirus vaccines. But it’s not certain they’ll work yet.

The basic building blocks for any vaccine development is virological understanding of the proteins involved in pathogenesis. I will focus on covid-19 as an example here.

The majority of bioinformatics work is based around the spike protein as is wetlab vaccine development. This gene is immediately after the 20 kb of ORF1ab, including the RNA dependent RNA polymerase, its around 3.5 kb but it might be a bit bigger. The spike protein is a major B-cell (antibody) antigenic determinant and the cellular receptor sites are located within it. Your bioinformatics could ultimately focus on targeting these specific sites, in particular using antigenic (antibody) prediction algorithms. 

First you need some basic biology of spike and hydrophobicity prediction is a good starting point such as TMHMM here and consider the SARS spike protein structure for example here. Once you've a handle on those structures antigenicity scanning would be a next phase analysis and possibly homology modelling. This is because COVID-19 and SARS are closely related, but there are key differences. You finally consider the full range of amino acid mutations in current epidemic via NCBI.

At this point you would target a specific vaccine design strategy and have a clearer understanding on the approach you wish to take. Good luck!

Is it possible for you to shift grading away from an exam and toward something else?  A project, for example?  Before going back to academia I spent years working as a policy researcher, and exam conditions simply aren't a realistic test of real-life coding abilities.  For that matter, coding with the internet turned off is also not remotely what real work looks like either.

In my class I like to give a larger project and let them have a few weeks to work on it, but I could also imagine a more simple project that they only have a few days, or even hours, to do.  Real data work often comes with time constraints, but it does not come with a lack of internet access in exam-like conditions.  Just scale the scope of the project based on how long you want them to have to work on it.

There is still a huge advantage to knowing the material, rather than having to look it up.  You can also grade on the quality of code and correctness of results, and allow for creativity with open-ended questions like ""summarize this data with two plots"".  This way each student is not only tested their knowledge of R, they're tested on their actual ability to use R in a realistic environment.

If you, unfortunately, are required to give an exam, I know there is software available for proctoring online tests.  The sort of thing that utilizes their webcams to make sure they don't leave during the test, or consult other devices, or open other web pages.  I've not used them though, so I couldn't make a recommendation.  I imagine they all require university subscriptions.

You presumably did some research before deciding on where to apply to in the first place. That research is still valid. Any other contact with the institution(s) and faculty add to that basis of judgement. 
You seem to presume that there is one uniquely right answer on your choice, and that getting to that one answer requires attending an open house. Likely, almost any choice could turn out well, or turn out badly, all depending on factors totally divorced from the open house. 
Note that many people accept without having been to an open house. So, the decision can be made without going to one. 
You seem to presume that actions to reduce the spread of the virus are unethical, something that I would hotly contest.

Virus or not, the world will move on from this crisis, hopefully in a timeframe of a few months, you will still need a job, and the university will still need faculty to teach classes and do research. Students will still need to be educated. Higher education can be affected by economic recession, put probably less so than many other sectors of the economy. So don’t panic.

So yes, it’s fine to send them an email and politely inquire about the status of the search. Keep in mind that it’s possible they are scrambling to figure out how to keep instruction going and dealing with other urgent matters around the current crisis unrelated to faculty hiring.

Yes, occupying your co-advisor's attention when the roof is on fire is tone-deaf. However: you have acquired skills that are obviously in high demand these days, and are thrown into a (hopefully) once-in-a lifetime situation to apply these skills. Especially since you're not on a strict deadline with your thesis, there are now more important things than finishing the thesis at the scheduled time. See this as an opportunity, not an obstacle.

Check if this is okay with your primary advisor, then send a mail to your co-advisor saying that you would be glad to put your thesis on ice and help her with her COVID work if she has anything you could be of help with. If you are a capable student, she probably will.  

Then, when things have calmed down, reevaluate the situation, see what you have learned in the meantime, and continue from there.

I think this is completely appropriate, for the same reasons as argued on this related thread. Note: I added ""scholarhip awarded"", but obviously you should not put that if there was no scholarship :)

In general, the purpose of your CV is to brag as much as possible; include everything that sounds impressive, even if you personally don't think it's that impressive. For instance, if you got accepted to two programs and only could attend one, I would list both. It's the same thing here -- the fact that COVID-19 is the circumstance is just a detail, not relevant to whether the acceptance is appropriate to list.

It allows children to progress through different subjects, includes videos to teach them each subject and then offers practice questions to help them master subjects.

I in particular use the ""MAP Recommended Practice"" feature with my son, who is a fairly advanced math student.  You can enter their test scores in, and based on those test scores it recommends the next lessons for them to take to ensure appropriate subject matter and difficulty.

I have been offering my children 2 hours of Khan Academy per day, plus 1 hour of reading, 1 hour of practice programming (using Scratch or Python), and 1 hour of more gamified learning (such as Prodigy, which is basically Pokémon but with math problems needing to be solved in order to do damage to your opponent!).  I intersperse an hour of video gaming time and an hour of playing either outside or around the house (but mobile, not sitting time) in order to keep them active.

The World Health Organization is an agency of the United Nations. But it does not have any legislative powers. Its activities are limited to spending its budget on funding health-related research, spreading health information and funding healthcare projects which operate within the legal framework of the countries they operate in. 

It might advise governments to take actions, like for example fund healthcare measures, discourage/promote products depending on their health impact, enact quarantines or discourage/promote certain medical procedures. But it does not have the authority to enforce any of those measures themselves.

Now what exactly does it mean that the WHO declares a public health emergency of international concern? It is basically just a declaration, stating that the WHO believes that this is a problem people should take seriously. The WHO has done that 5 times before, each time in case of a global outbreak of an acute infectious disease:


2009 (Swine Flu)
2014 (Polio)
2014 (Ebola)
2016 (Zika)
2019 (Kivu Ebola)

It may be futile to sue in US courts, since China will not enforce US judgments. You can sue a Chinese company in Chinese court, under their Civil Procedure Law, but this pertains to contract breach. The question is whether there is any law under which the government of China can be sued for negligence – it is unlikely that that is possible (perhaps there is an expert in Chinese law here who can address that issue).

This lawsuit is filed in US courts. It is based on the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. Supposing that this lawsuit is successful in US courts, then the question is what enforcement actions are possible. Since the defendants are various governments and government agencies in China, execution of the judgment would have to be against those defendants – you can't seize the assets of every person with some connection to China. But given the nature of the Chinese government, it is possible that US courts could find that the assets of Chinese companies are effectively government assets.

The short answer is, in fact a lawsuit has been filed, and I expect more. I also don't expect them to succeed in the long run.

I've decided, in the world of Twitter diplomacy, to count tweets from ministers and current/former heads of government as official responses for this purpose. Responses are in chronological order, culminating with the joint statement by President von der Leyen and President Michel.

The first response from a current or former head of government came from former Finnish Prime &amp; Foreign minister, Alexander Stubb who tweeted at 5:18 UTC:


  Any attempt to contain the #CoronaOutbreak is welcome, but the
  decision of  @realDonaldTrump  to exclude the UK from a European
  travel ban is nothing short of irresponsible. Viruses do not recognise
  borders. Decisions should be based on facts, not politics.


The European Council President, Charles Michel, then tweeted his initial response at 6:12 UTC, saying that


  Following the travel ban  @realDonaldTrump  announced, we will assess
  the situation today. 
  
  Economic disruption must be avoided. 
  
  #Europe is taking all necessary measures to contain the spread of the #COVID19 virus, limit the number of affected people and support research.


Former Prime Minister of Romania &amp; current leader of the Renew party in the European Parliament, Dacian Cioloş, tweeted that


  Viruses know no borders or nationalities. Nationalism &amp; blame games
  are no antidote. This is a global crisis, which requires global
  solidarity,  @realDonaldTrump . Containment measures are needed, but
  not arbitrary ones. Europe will be your partner, but not your
  scapegoat. #COVID19


Speaking to BBC Breakfast, British Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that the UK had no plan to emulate the US travel ban. (I am aware the UK is no longer an EU member, but I feel this response is still relevant.)


  We haven't believed that that's the right thing to do, the evidence
  here doesn't support that.
  
  What we are trying to do is contain the virus while recognising that
  it is now likely that it will spread more significantly.


Guy Verhofstadt, former Prime Minister of Belgium, tweeted at 9:51 UTC that:


  Nationalism isn't the answer to #COVID19, because viruses don't care
  about borders or nationalities. We are all in this together. We need a
  European approach to save lives &amp; bold interventions to protect our
  economy.


At 10:40 UTC, an official joint statement was released by President Ursula von der Leyen and President Charles Michel:


  The Coronavirus is a global crisis, not limited to any continent and
  it requires cooperation rather than unilateral action.
  
  The European Union disapproves of the fact that the U.S. decision to
  improve a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation.
  
  The European Union is taking strong action to limit the spread of the
  virus.

That’s why we don’t shut down the economy every flu season. They’re ignoring the costs of what they’re doing. They also have very little clue how many lives they’re saving.” [...]
  
  “Making people poorer has health consequences as well,” said Kip Viscusi, an economist at Vanderbilt University who has spent his career using economic techniques to assess the costs and benefits of government regulations.
  
  Jobless people sometimes commit suicide. The poor are likelier to die if they get sick. Mr. Viscusi estimates that across the population, every loss of income of $100 million in the economy causes one additional death.
  
  Government agencies calculate these trade-offs regularly. The Environmental Protection Agency, for instance, has established a cost of about $9.5 million per life saved as a benchmark for determining whether to clean up a toxic waste site.
  
  Other agencies use similar values to assess whether to invest in reducing accidents at an intersection or to tighten safety standards in a workplace. The Department of Agriculture has a calculator to estimate the economic costs — medical care, premature deaths, productivity loss from nonfatal cases — of food-borne disease.


So, the argument [in there] is that governments always make such trade-offs/choices, whether they are incredibly open about them or less so.



I should also mention (here, in case comments get purged again) that the NYT article discusses in a bit more depth the finer points of balancing the economic losses from lockdowns with those that would occur in an unchecked epidemic. This topic has been a addressed in some recent economics publications, e.g. Eichenbaum et al. discussed in the NYT article; but see also a simpler ""lockdowns 101 economics"". For the broader economic aspects of the crisis see also ""The Economics of Coronavirus"" on Econ SE.

""There's no serious effort to grapple with what could happen in the event of a major catastrophe,"" said Norm Ornstein, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who pushed for plans in the wake of Sept. 11.

So far, congressional leaders have [resisted calls for remote voting](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/politics/coronavirus-congress- voting.html), calling it a bad precedent and saying they need to address the current crisis. They have instead looked for ways to practice social distancing within the Capitol.

The April 2020 ballot does include the U.S. presidential primary, but that will have little effect on state politics.  After I first posted this answer, the New York Times echoed many of the points I make below, starting with:


  Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders are on the ballot in Wisconsin, but the main event is the State Supreme Court race between the conservative incumbent justice, Daniel Kelly, and a liberal challenger, Jill Karofsky.


Wisconsin has an elected state supreme court that currently has 5 conservatives and 2 liberals.  One of the conservatives (Daniel Kelly) is up for election in April 2020, and the another conservative is up in the next election after that (Pat Rogensack, 2023).  If liberals win both of those seats back, they would have a 4-3 majority and could undo the laws that keep the minority Republican party in power.


  The election determined the size of the court's conservative majority. A win for Karofsky would have reduced the conservative majority to 4-3, meaning that the next regularly scheduled election in 2023 would decide control of the court. A Kelly win would have preserved the court's 5-2 conservative majority.
  
  Ballotpedia


It's helpful to understand the political context:


For decades prior to 2010, Wisconsin was a moderate state.  The legislature and governorship each frequently flipped between the Democratic and Republican parties.  Since 1900, Wisconsin has equally chosen Republicans and Democrats for President.
Justices on the state supreme court are elected and technically nonpartisan.  Nonetheless, their conservative versus liberal ideology are often clear.  For decades prior to 2010, the state supreme court held a liberal majority.
It's worth mentioning that long ago, Wisconsin Republicans were leaders in open elections and progressive ideas.  The Republican party started in Wisconsin, as an anti-slavery party (later to be re-started in Michigan).  The word ""progressive"" was coined by Republican Robert La Follette.  Wisconsin was the first or among the first states to adopt women's suffrage, open ballots, primary elections, recall elections, referenda, outlawing child labor, worker's compensation, and income taxes; all were progressive Republican measures.  Prior to the Tea Party, the state was considered one of the most bipartisan and least corrupt states.
Led primarily by Tea Party candidates, in the fall 2010 election, Wisconsin Republicans won control of all three branches of government.  This included the election of Scott Walker as governor, a one-seat majority in the state senate, a considerable margin in the state assembly, and a 4 to 3 majority in the state supreme court.
Republicans quickly enacted a series of laws that would lock in their party's control:


Using sophisticated computer models to draw election maps for the U.S. House, state senate, and state assembly to maximize Republican seats and to pack Democratic votes into few districts.  The gerrymandering is so successful that in the 2018 elections, Republicans won 5 of 8 U.S. House seats with only 45.61% of votes, and 63 of 99 state assembly seats with only 44.75% of votes.
Adopting a voter-ID law.  Minorities and the poor -- who tend to vote for Democrats -- are less likely to have the proper types of identification.
Purged 234,000 voters from voting rolls.
Requiring early voting to be performed only at the municipal clerk's office, and not multiple sites.  Thus the 600,000 residents of Milwaukee (a Democratic stronghold) had only one site for early voting, the same as a town of 600 people would.  This law was struck down by a federal judge in 2016.


  
  A requirement that cities can have only one place for early voting. Critics have said large cities such as Milwaukee should be able to have multiple voting sites because not everyone can get downtown easily.
  

Limiting the days and hours for early and absentee voting.
Replacing the agency which oversees elections, from the Government Accountability Board composed of judges chosen by other judges, to the Wisconsin Election Commission chosen by politicians.
Moving the state supreme court elections from the fall (which have high Democratic turnout) to the spring (which have poor Democratic turnout).  This has been particularly effective at increasing the conservative control of the court, from 3-4 in 2010 to 7-2 in 2020.  Note how the election during the pandemic is a spring election, with a supreme court contest.
Holding special elections to fill vacancies on unusual dates -- when Republicans turn out -- instead of the usual fall and spring election dates when Democrats turn out.
After a series of failed recall elections for the governor and Republicans in the state senate, changes that made recalls more difficult (2015 Act 117).
A series of laws (most famously 2011 Act 10) to cripple the power and finances of labor unions, which are the primary backers of Democratic candidates.
In 2015, changing the Chief Justice position from the most senior justice (a liberal) to being chosen by a majority of the court (conservatives).
In 2015, stripping the powers of the Democratic secretary of state.
Increasing the powers of the Republican governor and attorney general.  When Democrats won back these offices in 2018, the powers of those offices were reduced in a lame duck session.

The conservatives controlling the state supreme court have upheld most of the laws described above.  This includes laws that affected the justices' own re-election.  In particular, the decision specifically about whether to continue the election during the pandemic went along ideological lines.
Moderate Republicans were treated poorly by the dominant Tea Party faction.  The previous Republican leaders of the legislature -- Dave Schultz in the assembly and Mike Ellis in the senate -- were pushed out of leadership by Tea Party leaders.  Schultz would later testify in a gerrymandering case that Republicans were brought one-by-one to a law office, and were ordered to vote for the gerrymandered maps, else their own districts would be gerrymandered to make them lose.  In the ensuing years, many moderate Republicans quit the party in disgust, and many moderate office-holders were voted out in primaries by Tea Party candidates.  The loss of moderates had drained the support of the Republican party.
Since 2010, Democrats have been gaining ground.  By number of voters statewide, the Republican party is actually a minority party in Wisconsin.  Wisconsin's top Republican even admitted that they aren't the majority:


  After the Republican Robin Vos, the speaker of the Wisconsin Statehouse, said that “if you took Madison and Milwaukee out of the state election formula, we would have a clear majority.""


However, the measures described above are so effective that the state supreme court and both houses of the state legislature still remain in Republican control.
Democrats swept every statewide office in 2018: U.S. Senate, governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, secretary of state, and treasurer.  They had more votes in the U.S. House, but because of gerrymandering, they won only 3 of 8 seats.  They also had more votes in the state assembly and gained one seat, but again because of gerrymandering, they did not gain control.
As has happened nationwide, the Wisconsin Republican party has aligned with rural interests and and the Democratic party with urban interests.  COVID-19 is likely to keep people in high-density (i.e. Democratic) districts at home.  Like other rural places in the U.S., rural Wisconsinites believe that COVID-19 is a ""big city"" phenomenon and are likely to show up to the polls.  Per the New York Times, about one of the least populous counties:


  Bruce Johnson, the Democratic chairman in Pepin County, along the state’s western border with Minnesota, said he pushed for absentee balloting but people were less concerned because they rarely wait in lines to vote.


Wikipedia:


  When the election went ahead on 7 April, access to easy in-person voting heavily depended on where voters were located. In smaller or more rural communities, which tend to be whiter and vote Republican, few issues were reported.


It's therefore in the interest of Republicans to keep the election going during the pandemic.
Should liberals take back the state supreme court, they can overturn the system of laws which keeps the Republican party in power.  They would then be at the mercy of the voters, who have been increasingly voting Democratic.

In short, private sector corporations are considered as a single employer and thus count each employee within the company. If the employee count is greater than 500 the corporation in question is exempt from paid leave due to COVID-19

For what kind of coverage a smaller company can expect, this fact sheet also provided by DoL states that:


  Generally, the Act provides that employees of covered employers are eligible for:
  
  
  Two weeks (up to 80 hours) of paid sick leave at the employee’s regular rate of pay where the employee is unable to work because the employee is quarantined (pursuant to Federal, State, or local government order or advice of a health care provider), and/or experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and seeking a medical diagnosis; or
  Two weeks (up to 80 hours) of paid sick leave at two-thirds the employee’s regular rate of pay because the employee is unable to work because of a bona fide need to care for an individual subject to quarantine (pursuant to Federal, State, or local government order or advice of a health care provider), or to care for a child (under 18 years of age) whose school or child care provider is closed or unavailable for reasons related to COVID-19, and/or the employee is experiencing a substantially similar condition as specified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretaries of the Treasury and Labor; and
  Up to an additional 10 weeks of paid expanded family and medical leave at two-thirds the employee’s regular rate of pay where an employee, who has been employed for at least 30 calendar days, is unable to work due to a bona fide need for leave to care for a child whose school or child care provider is closed or unavailable for reasons related to COVID-19.
  


To summarize, paid leave applies if the private sector employee shows symptoms of COVID-19, is told to self-quarantine by health care provider, is quarantined by federal/state/local order, or if employee is taking care of a family member that qualifies for one of the above reasons or if employee's child(ren) is stuck at home due to school/daycare closures related to COVID-19.

Federal employees are still covered by Title II of the Family and Medical Leave Act, which was not amended by the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.

  Is filing I-539 the easiest way to extend her stay at this time?


Yes.  It's also the hardest way.  It's the only way.

More seriously, there could be some sort of amnesty or other program offered to nonimmigrants in the US who are affected by the pandemic.  If that happens, it could save you a few hundred dollars.

But I wouldn't count on it.  I certainly haven't heard any mention of it, and the current administration is profoundly anti-immigrant, so it's unlikely to happen without political pressure.

In terms of risk analysis, the application fee will be well spent.


  If so, is it possible to waive the fee due to the Corona virus situation?


Applying for a fee waiver is going to make her look like someone with financial problems, which will have a negative impact on her application as well as future applications for admission to the US.  I would not do it.


  After filing I-539 should she wait for an approval to continue her stay? Or is the receipt good enough?


Once the application is filed, she can remain until it is refused, or, if it is granted, until the end of the period of extended stay that is granted.

Given the uncertainty, I decided to call US Customs and Border protection (didn't even know I could; was only on hold for 3 minutes.) They said that her current plan is just as risky as coming to SFO 15 or 17 days since leaving the Schengen Area. The remaining risk is just due to the discretionary power of the CBP officer, and the CBP person on the phone said that she had heard of travelers getting turned away more than 14 days after exiting the Schengen Area because of this discretion. In her words to me, ""I just hope she gets a good officer.""

The one bit of advice she did give is to print out and provide documentation of travel and the relevant dates, etc., to make the situation clear to the CBP officer approving (or not) entry.

","While the other two sort out their disagreement, here's one way the broadcast of misinformation is regulated which is not subject to dispute.

There is a federal agency called the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  The FCC regulates interstate and international communications over TV, radio, satellite, cable, etc., throughout the US and its territories.  

Among its duties and powers, it prohibits the broadcast of false info regarding a crime or catastrophe if the broadcaster ""knows the information is false and will cause substantial 'public harm' if aired.""  FCC rules indicate that the harm ""must begin immediately and cause direct and actual damage to property or the health or safety of the general public; or divert law enforcement or public health and safety authorities from their duties."" 

Additionally, while law prohibits the FCC from engaging in censorship or otherwise infringing on First Amendment rights of the press, it is nonetheless illegal for ""broadcasters to intentionally distort the news, and the FCC may act on complaints if there is documented evidence of such behavior from persons with direct personal knowledge."" 

The FCC may not interfere with how a broadcaster chooses to select or present news or commentary and its authority to respond to complaints regarding the above is narrow in scope.  Generally, it cannot intervene without testimony from a person with ""direct personal knowledge of an intentional falsification of the news."" 

The FCC's authority for this may be found at 47 CFR § 73.1217, which states: 


  § 73.1217 Broadcast hoaxes. 
  No licensee or permittee of any broadcast
  station shall broadcast false information concerning a crime or a
  catastrophe if:
  
  (a) The licensee knows this information is false;
  
  (b) It is forseeable that broadcast of the information will cause
  substantial public harm, and
  
  (c) Broadcast of the information does in fact directly cause
  substantial public harm.
  
  Any programming accompanied by a disclaimer will be presumed not to
  pose foreseeable harm if the disclaimer clearly characterizes the
  program as a fiction and is presented in a way that is reasonable
  under the circumstances.


Important context is included in the accompanying note, which states: 


  For purposes of this rule, “public harm” must begin immediately, and
  cause direct and actual damage to property or to the health or safety
  of the general public, or diversion of law enforcement or other public
  health and safety authorities from their duties. The public harm will
  be deemed foreseeable if the licensee could expect with a significant
  degree of certainty that public harm would occur. A “crime” is any act
  or omission that makes the offender subject to criminal punishment by
  law. A “catastrophe” is a disaster or imminent disaster involving
  violent or sudden event affecting the public.


EDIT: Addition:

More helpful context may come from Sec. 4 of this law review article and you may find the article in general, about criminalizing false speech on social media, interesting: https://jolt.law.harvard.edu/assets/articlePDFs/v31/31HarvJLTech65.pdf

  WHO officials have criticised the UK government's approach to the COVID-19 pandemic


Actually the quoted criticism does not come from the WHO, nor from a current employee of the WHO. It comes from 


  Professor Anthony Costello, ex-director of maternal and child health at the World Health Organisation


The criticism is of the claim that the UK government should


  ""just let 60% of the population get it""


These appear to be the words of a radio presenter not a published policy of the UK government.

The UK's Health Secretary recently said Herd immunity is not the policy of the UK government.


  “Herd immunity is not our policy. It’s not our goal. Our goal is to protect life and our policy is to fight the virus and protect the vulnerable and protect the NHS. And that’s what we’re doing. Now there is a, of course there’s a scientific debate around scientific concepts, but I want to be absolutely crystal clear that we will do what is necessary to protect life,”


So the premise is questionable.



The subject of herd immunity and the 60% figure came from an interview with the chief scientific adviser to the UK government. He was apparently speaking about the conditions for a potential resurgence of COVID-19 next winter and beyond. 




  Does the World Health Organization have the power to impose sanctions?


Not really, not of the sort the question seems to suggest.

The WHO did impose sanctions on a news-media organisation that leaked information in advance of a publication date. WHO banned the organisation from its press conferences for two weeks.

Any UN member state can apply for membership of the WHO. It seems likely the WHO can, as a sanction, expel a member from the WHO. I suspect only the UN itself could expel a state from the UN.

In the past, the WHO has been associated with criticisms of punitive sanctions on countries as hampering the objectives of the WHO. The WHO seems to generally aim to assist rather than punish countries.

Like any individual or organization, the WHO can advocate for or against a sanction. As a UN specialized agency it is likely to be listened to by the UN assemblies. As I understand it, it does not have the power itself to commit the UN to sanctions.

It is normally UN member states who would apply and enforce punitive sanctions following a resolution of the UN security council of which the UK is a permanent member with veto rights.

","The implications seem to be indefinite near-dictatorship for so long as Viktor Orbán chooses.  For those who are interested, an (unofficial, I believe) English translation of the bill can be found here.

Under the new legislation, by-elections are suspended and Orbán can rule by decree, suspend enforcement of laws, and arrest people for years under vague charges of ""publicizing distorted facts"" or ""violating quarantine"":


  The Hungarian parliament on Monday voted by a two-thirds majority to allow the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree without a set time limit.
  
  While the new legislation remains in place, no by-elections can be held and Orbán's government will be able to suspend the enforcement of certain laws. Plus, individuals who publicize what are viewed as untrue or distorted facts — and which could interfere with the protection of the public, or could alarm or agitate a large number of people — now face several years in jail.


Though advertised as ""emergency powers"", these new powers will last indefinitely and can only be removed with the approval of the President:


  The new rules can only be lifted with another two-thirds vote of the parliament and a presidential signature
  
  Hungary’s Viktor Orbán wins vote to rule by decree - Politico


The New York Times provides similar information:


  In Hungary, a new law has granted Prime Minister Viktor Orban the power to sidestep Parliament and suspend existing laws. Mr. Orban, who declared a state of emergency this month, now has the sole power to end the emergency. ...
  
  The law will permanently amend two articles of the criminal code that will further limit freedom of expression and penalize people for breaching quarantine orders. It will also suspend all elections and referendums.
  
  Under one measure, anyone who disseminates information that could hinder the government’s response to the epidemic could face up to five years in prison. The legislation gives broad latitude to the public prosecutor to determine what counts as distorted or false information.
  
  For Autocrats, Coronavirus Is a Chance to Grab Even More Power - The New York Times




The Independent Hungarian newspaper Index has more detail.

The government can expand emergency declarations indefinitely without Parliamentary approval:


  The new law allows the government to make these extensions themselves indefinitely, or at least until Parliament decides to revoke this authorisation before the state of emergency is over


It gives the government vague and expansive powers to arrest people for ""false or distorting"" speech:


  The new law also introduces a vaguely worded new paragraph to the already existing offence of scaremongering in the Criminal Code, which opponents of the law say could threaten critical press:
  
  
    ""Anyone who, under a special legal order, in public, utters or spreads statements known to be false or statements distorting true facts shall be punishable by imprisonment between 1 to 5 years if done in a manner capable of hindering or derailing the effectiveness of the response effort.""
  


And it give them the power to suspend laws and cancel elections:


  The Coronavirus Act also introduces a number of other changes to the constitutional order of the country:
  
  
  The government will be allowed to take steps beyond the extraordinary measures listed in the Disaster Relief Act and suspend the application of certain laws by decree if necessary and proportional to protect citizens' health, life, property, rights, and to secure the stability of the economy in connection with the pandemic. ...
  No local or national elections or referendums can be held until the end of the state of emergency, elections and referendums already scheduled will take place after the special legal order ends. Municipal councils dissolved during the state of emergency stay in place until the end of the special legal order.

","Well, one obvious justification is that it means the parliament does not have to assemble. 


It is difficult to organize a parliamentary debate while keeping social distancing.
What if some legislators get into contact with an infected person. Could they still speak and cast their vote, or would they be banned during the quarantine period?


Of course the parliament could e.g. have put a narrow expiry date on the rules, but who knows how feasible a session would be three or six months from now? An expiry of ""after the pandemic"" would be too fuzzy. 



My personal opinion is that the parliament should have found a way to stay relevant, but the question asked for possible justifications.

An option might have been to change parliamentary rules to reduce the quorum, possibly combined with pairing, or to allow online debates and voting, but those are difficult for democracy as well.

  Is there any international travel rule which prohibits a country from refusing entry to its own citizens?


Yes.


  The Right of return  is a principle in international law which guarantees everyone's right of voluntary return to or re-enter their country of origin or of citizenship. 
  
  The right is formulated in several modern treaties and conventions, most notably in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the 1948 Fourth Geneva Convention. The Geneva Conventions, it has been argued, have passed into customary international law and that the right of return is binding on non-signatories to the conventions




The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights says


  Article 13.
  
  (1) Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state.
  (2) Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.

","The airline did NOT cancel your flight.  They cancelled a flight that you were not booked on at the time of the cancellation.  It is as simple as this.  You were not booked on the flight, so you are due no compensation.

IF you had not already canceled your tickets, and you were still booked on the flight at the time of the cancellation, then you might have been due compensation under EU261, but it's very likely that the airline would consider an epidemic to be ""extraordinary circumstances"" which removes the need for the airline to provide compensation.

Addition to address the update to the question :
Simplistically speaking, airline bookings have two parts - a ""reservation"" which covers the booking on specific flight segments on specific days, and a ""ticket"" which basically shows that you have paid for those flights.  When you book a flight, first a reservation is created, then you pay, and then a ticket is issued.

When you cancel flights, the reservation of those flights is cancelled.  At that point, you are no longer booked on those flights, although you still potentially hold a ticket.  This will happen immediately that you ask for the flights to be cancelled, as the airline wants to be able to free up the seats so they can sell them to someone else.  No refund will be made as a part of cancelling a reservation.

At this point, you hold a ticket that states you've paid $X for, but which contains no flight segments as they have been cancelled.  Depending on the airline, the actual ticket you purchased, and any special conditions the airline might allow (such as allowing refunds during an event like an epidemic even if the ticket doesn't normally allow refunds), the value on that ticket might be lost entirely, might be only able to be used to book a future flight, or might allow a refund.

In order to actually get the refund, whoever issued the ticket (which might be the airline you were flying, another airline, or a travel agency) will need to cancel it and process the refund back to you.  This is a separate step in the process, and it could happen hours, days, or even months after the reservation was cancelled.

However none of that changes the fact that once the reservation has been updated, you were no longer booked on that flight, and thus no longer due compensation.

","From what I can find of official information, the Czech Republic has suspended the processing of visa applications and issuance of visa at the embassy in Beijing and the consulates in China (Shanghai, Chengdu) and Hong Kong. It is worth to notice that this restriction affects also non-chinese residents of China, who are now also not able to apply for a visa.

Some media have indeed reported that the visa ban applies to all Chinese citizens, but there is no official information supporting that and I believe these reports to be mistakes. It seems very well possible for Chinese citizens who are resident outside China to get a Czech visa from the consulates at their place of residence and there seem to be no ban for residents of China to enter the Czech Republic if they are already in posession of a visa.

Unless the Czech Republic is the main destination in the Schengen area, it should also still be possible for Chinese residents to obtain a Schengen visa from other consulates and then use that visa for travel to the Czech Republic. It will probably have little impact on actual travel patterns for a single Schengen country to impose restrictions as have been done here.

","I assume you have already travelled London - Zurich, and it is your return which has been cancelled, stranding you in Switzerland.

Whilst Switzerland is not in the EU, it is a signatory to EC261/2004. Thus cancellation of a departure from Zurich is covered by that regulation. 

Since these are extraordinary circumstances, you will be unlikely to receive the usual levels of compensation for a cancellation within 14 days of scheduled departure. 

However, this is distinct from the duty of care provisions. Provided you have not opted for refund on your cancelled flight, then guidance issued just yesterday confirms that this still applies, despite (or arguably, because of) a potentially lengthy stay: 


  According to Article 9 of the Regulation, which provides all relevant details, passengers
  who are affected by a flight cancellation must also be offered care by the operating air
  carrier, free of charge. This consists of meals and refreshments in a reasonable relation to
  the waiting time; hotel accommodation if necessary, and transport to the place of
  accommodation. Moreover, airports are to provide assistance to disabled passengers and
  passengers with reduced mobility in accordance with Regulation 1107/20069
  .
  
  It is worth recalling that when the passenger opts for reimbursement of the full cost of the
  ticket, the right to care ends. The same happens when the passenger chooses re-routing at
  a later date at the passenger's convenience (Article 5(1)(b) in conjunction with Article
  8(1)(c)).
  
  The right to care subsists only as long as passengers have to wait for a rerouting at the
  earliest convenience (Article 5(1)(b) in conjunction with Article 8(1)(b)).
  
  The intention underlying the Regulation is that the needs of passengers waiting for their
  return flight or re-routing are adequately addressed. The extent of adequate care will have
  to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the needs of passengers in the
  circumstances and the principle of proportionality (i.e.: according to the waiting time).
  The price paid for the ticket or the length of the inconvenience suffered should not
  interfere with the right to care (Interpretative Guidelines Point 4.3.2).
  
  According to the Regulation, the air carrier is obliged to fulfil the obligation of care even
  when the cancellation of a flight is caused by extraordinary circumstances, that is to say
  circumstances that could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been
  taken.
  
  The Regulation contains nothing that recognises a separate category of 'particularly
  extraordinary' events, beyond the 'extraordinary circumstances' referred to in Article 5(3)
  of the Regulation. The air carrier is therefore not exempted from all of its obligations,
  including those under Article 9 of the Regulation, even during a long period. Passengers
  are especially vulnerable in such circumstances and events.10 In exceptional events, the
  intention of the Regulation is to ensure that adequate care is provided in particular to
  passengers waiting for re-routing under Article 8(1)(b) of the Regulation.

That said, the regulation does in fact specify reimbursement within seven days.  So you could pursue them if you want to.  Short of hiring a lawyer, the regulation provides that you can seek enforcement through the national enforcement body designated under Article 16(1).

","EDIT: This is a fast evolving situation. Under the current circumstances I suggest anyone planning to come to Europe just cancel or postpone. 

A Schengen visa normally allows one to enter any Schengen country. 
There is no obligation to enter the Schengen area through the country that issued your visa. 
So entering via France (or any other country) is not an issue. 
It is pretty common even.

The rule that you must apply to the consulate of the country that is your main destination exists to spread the workload, and to counter visa shopping. 
To enforce that rule the immigration officer stamping you in may want to see hotel and flight reservations proving that indeed you plan to follow the itinerary on your Schengen Visa application. 
Arriving at the border with evidence suggesting that your plans are very different from those stated in your application will raise red flags, and may lead to a refusal.

This under normal circumstances. 
However we are no longer under normal circumstances. 
Deciding to no longer visit Italy is completely reasonable in light of the current situation. 
So I would guess that cutting Italy out of your plans is not going to raise a red flag. 
You should however inquire with the French consulate and the  French border police (dcpaf-em-cnic@interieur.gouv.fr).

One last thing: 
The way things are currently progressing all of Europe will be where Italy is now in about 10 days (and so might your home country). 
You might want to completely postpone your trip.

They are all different, so you need to read the exclusions of the one that you have or plan on getting. They also get updated frequently.

As it currently stands, travel into the 26 EU states as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, is prohibited for 30 days and as such travel is banned for all non-EU citizens or residents (except UK citizens).

Assuming your travel request falls within this period then the following is likely.


They could reject you current application and tell you to reapply in
the future.  That this rejection will not be looked upon negatively
when you apply, and you should get a full refund of any fees paid.
Or they could put your application on hold and ask you in the future
if you wish to proceed or not with new dates.  If not, then you would
get a full refund.
They could approve your visa, but issue it with different dates and/or
an extended travel period.  e.g.  instead of 90 in 180 days, then 90
in 270 days.


If your travel request is for later than this period then the following could occur:


Issue the visa but advise you that you will only be able to travel if
the borders reopen.  If the borders don't reopen in time, you have to
apply again.  You may or may not have to pay the fees again in such a case.
Stop processing and ask you if you wish to postpone or withdraw your
application, and refund the fees
Stop processing temporarily.  Continue processing when the situation
improves, if your application is far enough in the future
Reject the application, and tell you to reapply again when the situation is clearer.  Refund the fees.


If the visa is rejected due to the Corona shutdown, then it will not be looked upon negatively when you apply again in the future and you should get a full refund.

  does that mean every one in the world at some point has to get infected until a vaccine is invented?


No. There are many infectous diseases which are only regional, or have been almost eradicated. Countries free of (this or that) disease need to act quickly on imported cases, if the disease is highly infectuous. 

On the other hand, if the spread of a pathogen in a (say closed) region is slowed down substantially, people who have developed immunity in this region will generally make the reproductive factor of the epidemic lower - and thus make it easier to contain its spread. 

You may have a look at the last simulation in:
https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/
where the epidemic can in many cases self-extinguish itself by that effect.

","While it has clearly been shown by the virility of the virus so far that travel restrictions will not stop the inevitable community spread of the illness, and that their effectiveness as impeding the spread of the virus is small, the aim of the policy is no longer to stop the virus, but to delay it. This was confirmed as current policy in the UK's response to the virus by the Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty, on March 5th.

There are a few reasons why this is the goal of many governments. Firstly, if the peak of the pandemic can be delayed, this allows plans to be put in place for management of the crisis. For example, in the UK, plans have been floated that would allow final year medical students and trainee doctors to take on hospital duties during the nine week period that the virus is currently predicted to have the highest effect on the NHS, in order to mitigate the strain on the service.

Secondly, delaying the spread of the virus allows time for a vaccine to be developed. While research on this is progressing quickly, it will still take time for the vaccine to pass clinical trials and be approved for human usage. In addition, as @Patricia Shanahan points out in the comments, the effectiveness of existing drugs already approved for treating similar respiratory diseases can be evaluated, which could be ready sooner than developing brand new drugs or a vaccine.

Finally, as health services are acknowledged as being under the most strain during the winter months, the best time for the pandemic to peak would be in the middle of summer.

To this end, the policy of travel bans, while having been shown to be relatively ineffective at preventing the spread of the disease outright, is being used to delay the spread of the virus as much as possible, to allow national governments to prepare for the full impact of the peak of the predicted pandemic.

init &lt;- c(S = N-1, I = 1, R = 0)

# should be

init &lt;- c(S = N-Infected[1], I = Infected[1], R = 0)


Unequal parameter scales

As other people have noted the equation  

$$I' = \beta \cdot S \cdot I - \gamma \cdot I$$

has a very large value for $S \cdot I$ this makes that the value of the parameter $\beta$ very small and the algorithm which checks whether the step sizes in the iterations reach some point will not vary the steps in $\beta$ and $\gamma$ equally (the changes in $\beta$ will have a much larger effect than changes in $\gamma$). 

You can change scale in the call to the optim function to correct for these differences in size (and checking the hessian allows you to see whether it works a bit). This is done by using a control parameter. In addition you might want to solve the function in segregated steps making the optimization of the two parameters independent from each others (see more here: How to deal with unstable estimates during curve fitting? this is also done in the code below, and the result is much better convergence; although still you reach the limits of your lower and upper bounds)

Opt &lt;- optim(c(2*coefficients(mod)[2]/N, coefficients(mod)[2]), RSS.SIR, method = ""L-BFGS-B"", lower = lower, upper = upper,
         hessian = TRUE, control = list(parscale = c(1/N,1),factr = 1))


more intuitive might be to scale the parameter in the function (note the term beta/N in place of beta)

SIR &lt;- function(time, state, parameters) {
  par &lt;- as.list(c(state, parameters))
  with(par, { dS &lt;- -beta/N * S * I
  dI &lt;- beta/N * S * I - gamma * I
  dR &lt;- gamma * I
  list(c(dS, dI, dR))
  })
}


Starting condition

Because the value of $S$ is in the beginning more or less constant (namely $S \approx N$) the expression for the infected in the beginning can be solved as a single equation:

$$I' \approx (\beta \cdot N - \gamma) \cdot I $$

So you can find a starting condition using an initial exponential fit:

# get a good starting condition
mod &lt;- nls(Infected ~ a*exp(b*day), 
           start = list(a = Infected[1],
                        b = log(Infected[2]/Infected[1])))


Unstable, correlation between $\beta$ and $\gamma$

There is a bit of ambiguity how to choose $\beta$ and $\gamma$ for the starting condition. 

This will also make the outcome of your analysis not so stable. The error in the individual parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$ will be very large because many pairs of $\beta$ and $\gamma$ will give a more or less similarly low RSS. 

The plot below is for the solution $\beta = 0.8310849; \gamma = 0.4137507 $



However the adjusted Opt_par value $\beta = 0.8310849-0.2; \gamma = 0.4137507-0.2$ works just as well:





Using a different parameterization

The optim function allows you to read out the hessian

&gt; Opt &lt;- optim(optimsstart, RSS.SIR, method = ""L-BFGS-B"", lower = lower, upper = upper,
+              hessian = TRUE)
&gt; Opt$hessian
            b            
b  7371274104 -7371294772
  -7371294772  7371315619


The hessian can be related to the variance of the parameters (In R, given an output from optim with a hessian matrix, how to calculate parameter confidence intervals using the hessian matrix?). But note that for this purpose you need the Hessian of the log likelihood which is not the same as the the RSS (it differs by a factor, see the code below).

Based on this you can see that the estimate of the sample variance of the parameters is very large (which means that your results/estimates are not very accurate). But also note that the error is a lot correlated. This means that you can change the parameters such that the outcome is not very correlated. Some example parameterization would be:

$$\begin{array}{}
 c &amp;=&amp; \beta - \gamma \\
 R_0 &amp;=&amp; \frac{\beta}{\gamma}
\end{array}$$

such that the old equations (note a scaling by 1/N is used):

$$\begin{array}{rccl}
S^\prime &amp;=&amp; - \beta \frac{S}{N}&amp; I\\
I^\prime &amp;=&amp; (\beta \frac{S}{N}-\gamma)&amp; I\\
R^\prime &amp;=&amp; \gamma &amp;I
\end{array}
$$

become

$$\begin{array}{rccl}
S^\prime &amp;=&amp; -c\frac{R_0}{R_0-1}  \frac{S}{N}&amp; I&amp;\\
I^\prime &amp;=&amp; c\frac{(S/N) R_0 - 1}{R_0-1} &amp;I&amp; \underbrace{\approx c I}_{\text{for $t=0$ when $S/N \approx 1$}}\\
R^\prime &amp;=&amp; c \frac{1}{R_0-1}&amp; I&amp;
\end{array}
$$

which is especially appealing since you get this approximate $I^\prime = cI$ for the beginning. This will make you see that you are basically estimating the first part which is approximately exponential growth. You will be able to very accurately determine the growth parameter, $c = \beta - \gamma$. However, $\beta$ and $\gamma$, or $R_0$, can not be easily determined.

In the code below a simulation is made with the same value $c=\beta - \gamma$ but with different values for $R_0 = \beta / \gamma$. You can see that the data is not capable to allow us differentiate which different scenario's (which different $R_0$) we are dealing with (and we would need more information, e.g. the locations of each infected individual and trying to see how the infection spread out).

It is interesting that several articles already pretend to have reasonable estimates of $R_0$. For instance this preprint Novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV: early estimation of epidemiological parameters and epidemic predictions (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018549)

How is R0 estimated?

The graph above (which is repeated below) showed that there is not much variation in the number of 'infected' as a function of $R_0$, and the data of the number of infected people is not providing much information about $R_0$ (except whether or not it is above or below zero).

However, for the SIR model there is a large variation in the number of recovered or the ratio infected/recovered. This is shown in the image below where the model is plotted not only for the number of infected people but also for the number of recovered people. It is such information (as well additional data like detailed information where and when the people got infected and with whom they had contact) that allows the estimate of $R_0$.



Update

In your blog article you write that the fit is leading to a value of $R_0 \approx 2$. 

However that is not the correct solution. You find this value only because the optim is terminating early when it has found a good enough solution and the improvements for given stepsize of the vector $\beta, \gamma$ are getting small. 

When you use the nested optimization then you will find a more precise solution with a $R_0$ very close to 1. 

We see this value $R_0 \approx 1$ because that is how the (wrong) model is able to get this change in the growth rate into the curve.

This is a restriction of the SIR model which models $R_0 = \frac{\beta}{\gamma}$ where $\frac{1}{\gamma}$ is the period how long somebody is sick (time from Infected to Recovered) but that may not need to be the time that somebody is infectious. In addition, the compartment models is limited since the age of patients (how long one has been sick) is not taken into account and each age should be considered as a separate compartment.

But in any case. If the numbers from wikipedia are meaningfull (they may be doubted) then only 2% of the active/infected recover daily, and thus the $\gamma$ parameter seems to be small (no matter what model you use).

At the moment, the federal government is doing a lot of warning. The CDC has produced two dozen guidance documents for hospitals, instructions for preparedness and infection control. Crucially, they are offering guidance on preserving personal protection equipment in a recognition that a widespread outbreak is likely to impact already-low supplies. While the declaration of a PHEIC is applicable globally, the temporary recommendations issued as a result of the declaration are not required to be, and in general, aren't. Philippines and Peru decide ban outbound international flights during pandemics. Americans have grown accustomed to “just-in-time” ordering. But that becomes a huge problem when international supply chains are disrupted by an outbreak. Therefore, US doesn't have enough medical supplies to handle this outbreak. Experts say the reason of US so far behind other countries with testing is due to cuts in federal funding for public health and problems with early testing. Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. The coronavirus relief bill is not yet law, and the IRS has yet to provide information about how it plans to implement the provision about the rebates. Will the hospitals remain open? Yes. Hospitals will operate normally. If you want to find the data or any project related with COVID-19, I recommend this github project from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). ","No, for a few reasons.  The most relevant is that, even if you could numerically determine the value of the intercept term in the model, you would not be able to tell what conditions are represented by the intercept term of the model fit by the researchers (unless they provided some very specific details about their methods, e.g., ""did they center their predictors"", etc.).

The way these models are defined, you need to know what the ""reference"" point of each coefficient is.  By convention the reference point for continuous variables is often zero, but the choice of reference is completely arbitrary for categorical variables (though it does appear to be stated in the article).

On a more conceptual note, models like this one are often limited in their ability to predict accurate ""class probabilities ""because their goal is to explain relationships between predictors, or to describe relative risk-reducing or risk-increasing relationships among the predictors in the model.  Often these models use only a limited number of variables to arrive at a parsimonious model, which tries to keep multicollinearity low, so that the individual effects of predictors are easier to interpret.  

Another way of looking at it is this:  The model may have been designed to address research questions  such as: ""what is the relative importance of age with respect to the risk of an in-hospital death after controlling for other demographic factors?"".  Even if the model does this very well, it may be very bad at answering fundamentally different questions, such as ""What is the probability that a female will experience an in-hospital death?""

The coronavirus relief bill is not yet law, and the IRS has yet to provide information about how it plans to implement the provision about the rebates. Will the hospitals remain open? Yes. Hospitals will operate normally. If you want to find the data or any project related with COVID-19, I recommend this github project from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). ","This is actually a handbook example of determining the sample size needed for estimating binomial proportion (e.g. Jones et al, 2004, Naing, 2003 for other references and examples).

First of all, to make it more precise, we are talking about finding such sample size, that with probability $\alpha$, the difference between the true probability of being infected $p$ and it's estimate $\hat p$ is not greater then $(100\times\delta\,)\%$

$$
\Pr(|p - \hat p| \le \delta p) = \alpha
$$

Given that the target population is large, we would usually assume binomial distribution to represent it, i.e. we say that it is large enough, that the chance of randomly sampling someone more then once is negligible. The distribution is parametrized by probability of ""success"" (here, probability of being infected) $p$ and the number of samples we draw $n$. Let's denote the observed number of infected people as $k$, in such case, $\hat p = k/n$ is the fraction of infected people in the sample and we treat it as an estimate of the number of infected people in the whole population. If we wanted to calculate confidence interval for $\hat p$, we could use normal approximation

$$
\hat p \pm z_\alpha \sqrt{\frac{\hat p(1-\hat p)}{n}}
$$

where $z_\alpha$ is the ordinate from standard normal distribution, where for $z$ drawn from standard normal distribution we have $\Pr(-z_\alpha &lt; z &lt; z_\alpha) = \alpha$. You are saying, that you'd like to see this interval to be equal to $\hat p \pm \delta p$. As discussed in the linked resources, you can solve this, so that for given $p$, precision $\delta$, and certanity $\alpha$, you can guesstimate the sample size needed

$$
n \approx \Big(\frac{z_\alpha}{\delta p}\Big)^2 \; p(1-p)
$$

Assuming $(100 \times \alpha)\% = 99\%$ confidence interval, we can plot this for different values of $p$, to find out that for $100 \times p &gt; 4 \%$ the needed sample sizes are generally not much larger then $2000$ samples.



For example, for $p=0.04$ ($4\%$ infected) this yields:



&gt; z &lt;- function(alpha) qnorm(alpha)
&gt; n &lt;- function(p, alpha=0.99, delta=0.25) (z(alpha)/(p*delta))^2 * p*(1-p)
&gt; n(0.04)
[1] 2078.167


To convince yourself, you can verify this by simulation, where you would draw $n$ samples from binomial distribution with probability of infection $p$, repeat this procedure $R$ times, and then verify how often was your result not further then $(100 \times \delta) \%$ from the true value:

&gt; set.seed(123)
&gt; sim &lt;- function(p, n, delta, nsim=50000) mean(abs(p - rbinom(nsim, n, p)/n) / p &lt;= delta)
&gt; sim(0.04, 2078, 0.25)
[1] 0.97858


So we wanted to be $99\%$ sure and the approximation gives us, while the in the simulation, in $97.8\%$ cases the result was within the interval. Not bad.

Notice that this is just a simple approximation for the calculation, assuming simple random sampling. In case of whole population locked in their houses, sampling individuals at random may be not as hard as in case of most of the usual surveys. On another hand, things may not go as smooth as planned, or you may be willing to use other sampling schema, to have higher chance for it being representative, what would make calculating it more complicated. Moreover, the tests used aren't perfect and give false results as described, for example by New York Times, or Washington Post, and you'd need to account for that as well. Also you need to remember, there were many examples where such simple problems get more complicated then expected, e.g. social surveys on Trump's support before the election got very wrong, nonetheless that they used state of art survey methodology.

","ArXiv posts its monthly submission statistics here. It's noisy data even in the absence of viruses, so I can't tell if there's an effect yet or not. Then again, I'm no statistician. Extrapolating the March data as of today (March 19th), it's at least set to be larger than the February number of submissions, as is typical for March submissions.

However, even if the number of monthly arXiv submissions is to be considered a good proxy, it will likely lag by more time than we have seen so far. Yes, closures, adapting to online classes, and changed schedules will delay new experiments and other activities. However, finishing writing up manuscripts already in the pipeline, or analyzing already collected data are still productive tasks that will lead to new submissions for quite a while. Not to mention people such as myself, who can continue our theoretical/numerical work from home.

","It's a nice idea. Sadly it won't work but there is still some interesting physics involved.

As a general rule resonance is only an efficient way to transfer energy to an object if that object has a high Q factor. A high Q factor means the energy supplied builds up and increases the amplitude of the oscillation, and this may get large enough to damage the object. This is the (alleged) mechanism for the shattering of wine glasses by overenthusiastic sopranos. Wine glasses have a high Q and you can tell this by the way they ring for a while when you tap them. As a contrast, potatoes have a low Q and do not ring when you tap them. So our sopranos would have a hard time shattering a potato.

The problem with using ultrasound to kill cells or viruses is that in general they are squishy low Q objects like potatoes, not high Q objects like wine glasses, and they do not store the energy of the sound efficiently enough for the amplitude of oscillation to build up to destructive levels. So the technique simply won't work.

Ultrasound is used to kill tumours, but this does not work by resonance - the energy in the sound simply heats the cancer tissue and kills it. It is used for tumours because the sound can be focused onto the tumour where it causes local heating. This would not work for viral infections since the virus is distributed throughout the body not concentrated in one area onto which the sound can be targeted.

Even if viruses were brittle like glass it would still be hard to make them resonate enough to be damaged when they are in a fluid like water. There are two reasons for this.

Firstly water is much denser and much more viscous than air so it efficiently damps the vibrations of any objects moving in it. For example if you tap a glass underwater it will not ring as it does in air. So even objects that have a high Q factor in air will have a drastically lower Q factor in water. This applies to viruses in humans since as far as sound waves are concerned human tissue is little different from water.

Secondly sound waves are a compression wave and they propagate by alternately compressing and expanding the water. The amount the water compresses and stretches is determined by the bulk modulus and this is relatively high. That means the amplitude of the wave is small unless the energy is very high, and consequently the mechanical deformation of objects in the water by the wave is small. This makes it hard to deform the virus enough to damage it.

It's not as though we can gather everyone in a big room, put their names in a hat, and then call them out one-by-one to get tested. There are a number of different issues that need to be resolved, e.g.:


People are not randomly distributed. In the real world they cluster by race, religion, economic status, political affiliation, occupation, and other demographic factors. A purely random sample (unless it's immense) will likely underrepresent or overrepresent specific populations.
People are not easy to find. Say that Joe Smith is someone randomly chosen to be tested. What if we can't reach him by phone or email? What if we send a testing kit to him and he neglects to return it, or uses the kit incorrectly? What if we send a 'swabber' to his house, only to find he isn't home, or refuses to open the door? Depending on methodology, sampling in this context can have massive non-participation, and the more non-participants we see, the weaker our statistical results are.
People are not infected entirely randomly. Infections are a Markov chain, where one must be in specific kinds of contact with an infected person to have a chance of being infected, and then (if infected) must be in the same specific kinds of contact with uninfected people to pass it on. Modeling a Markov chain as though it were purely random misses important aspects of the way a disease is spread, and will skew results badly.
Perhaps most importantly, the spread of a pandemic is a fluid situation, not a stable characteristic of individuals. Collecting physical samples from people requires a tremendous amount of time and labor (driving to a home and collecting a sample, driving to another home and collecting a sample, repeat, repeat, drive back to homes where people were absent and try again). Even if we could muster a veritable army of 'swabbers' for our random sampling of nearly 400 million people, we can expect the actually swabbing to take at least a week (generously), and in a week the number of infections has doubled and doubled again. The first people swabbed are not being drawn from the same statistical population as the last people swabbed, and our statistics will suffer. And then we have to ask about our swabbers, who are all part of the population we are sampling, and all of whom have been exposed to large numbers of potentially infected people...


The upshot is that if we were to take the time to properly construct and implement a large-scale random sample, the disease would be spreading while we were designing the methodology, the disease would be spreading while we were implementing the testing, and by the time we finished running the data we collected the disease would have spread further, making our results all but useless. I'm not saying they would be entirely useless — with appropriate statistical manipulations we can account for many of these issues — but whatever use it has will be for future epidemiologists looking back on this pandemic.

This means that people who initially recovered are more likely to relapse rather than get reinfected with the virus. But, that doesn’t mean it isn’t possible to contract the disease again, especially in those who are immunocompromised.

It's not yet clear whether people can be reinfected by this coronavirus or how long immunity might last after infection. If you do an antibody test, in theory it could show that you had the virus and then recovered. It makes sense to wash unpackaged items such as fruit and vegetables thoroughly under running water, before leaving them to dry. You should also then wash your hands with soap and water.

Covid-19 is the result of a zoonotic outbreak from bats to an intermediate thence to humans.

There have been no cases of pets or insect passing the coronavirus to humans, and the same was true during the Sars outbreak in 2003, when there was not a single case of pet-to-human transmission. Coronavirus spreads from person to person by droplets from the nose or mouth from coughing or sneezing. People can also catch it by coming into contact with contaminated surfaces or skin. The WHO says ""other people then catch Covid-19 (coronavirus) by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth"". There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19.","Question 1


  [...] antibodies [...] can last anywhere between a few weeks to a few months. The antibodies themselves though (which are proteins) definitely don't last forever (like all proteins). Eventually certain suppressor cells kill off plasma cells after the response has taken its course, and all that remains are a few memory cells, which are reactivated again should the pathogen invade the body in the future.

For example, if a selected group of people were tested for Sars-CoV-2 antibodies every two weeks, the course of the epidemic would be clearly visible.

The interest, especially in business circles, is huge. Everyone urgently wanted to know where they were in the pandemic, who was at best already immune and could therefore probably move around and work safely again.

Such data could inform practical issues such as whether and how to reopen schools that have been closed. Relatively few cases have been diagnosed among children, but it isn’t clear whether that’s because they don’t get infected or because their infections are generally so mild that they go unnoticed. Testing children for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies should resolve that.

There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19.","There may be a chance some blood types have a higher risk of getting a serious dose of Covid-19 than others, a small early study suggests.

Researchers assessed 2,173 coronavirus hospital patients in Shenzhen and Wuhan in China, where the outbreak originated.

They found patients with A blood group types were more likely to have been hospitalised than average, while those with an O blood group type were less likely.

In the local population, 32% had a type A blood group, compared with 38% of those in hospital. Meanwhile, 34% of residents had type 0 blood, compared with 26% in hospital.

However, this study has not yet been peer reviewed and only covered a small area, so these links may be coincidental. Everyone should be doing all they can to avoid catching the virus and passing it on to others, regardless of their blood type."
14,56,What is the current policy on birthing partners?,"With “common cold coronaviruses, you don’t actually have immunity that lasts for very long, and so we don’t know the answer with this specific coronavirus,” said Dr. Celine Gounder, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the New York University School of Medicine. It seems likely that having the disease once results in immunity in most individuals - as is seen with other coronaviruses. This means that people who initially recovered are more likely to relapse rather than get reinfected with the virus. But, that doesn’t mean it isn’t possible to contract the disease again, especially in those who are immunocompromised. Because COVID-19 is a new virus, we don't know whether pregnant women are more susceptible than the general population.

Those with severe asthma have been placed in the ""extremely vulnerable"" group, meaning they are advised to stay at home for at least 12 weeks and should have been contacted by the government.
Those with mild asthma should still practise social distancing and only go out for essentials. If you start displaying coronavirus symptoms that do not improve after seven days, or you have difficulty breathing, make sure you call 111 or 999 and explain that you have asthma.
When people with asthma get respiratory infections, it can set off their asthma symptoms.

It points to early studies in China that indicate smokers with Covid-19 are 14 times more likely to develop severe respiratory disease.
Smoking tobacco or illegal drugs damages the lungs and airways, causing a range of respiratory problems. The coronavirus attacks the respiratory system, placing smokers at greater risk.
There is also evidence it suppresses and harms the immune system, with smokers twice as likely to catch pneumonia as non-smokers.
Smokers are also likely to regularly touch their mouth, increasing their risk of infection.

distancing policies in order to “flatten the curve” of infections, as Hong
Kong and Singapore successfully did, other experts are expressing concerns
about a “second wave” of infections after those regions experienced another

The most common way for the virus to be transmitted appears to be through close contact with an infected person.

However, evidence suggests the virus can live for an extended time outside of the body, including on surfaces. If you touch a contaminated surface and then your nose or mouth, there's a possibility you could become infected.

A study published last month suggests the virus survives longest on plastic and stainless steel surfaces - up to two to three days - and can live for up to 24 hours on cardboard. However, over that time the virus is likely to become less powerful.

Where possible, it is a good idea to either disinfect the packaging with kitchen spray or discard it before washing your hands with soap and water.

For items like a newspaper that can't be washed, the likelihood of transmission is low, but it still makes sense to practise regular hand washing.

Here's why.
So far, there aren't scientific findings on how long the virus can live on fabric. But fabrics are generally porous — as is cardboard, which has been tested. And a recent study did find that the virus can live on cardboard for up to 24 hours.
""The thing that you have to consider, though, is that those tests are done in ideal testing circumstances,"" says Rachel Graham, a virologist at the University of North Carolina. ""That's like in some kind of hermetically sealed box where there's no fluctuation in humidity, there's no wind, there's nothing that can contribute toward desiccating the virus. And so desiccation — or drying out the virus — would actually reduce the amount of time it's actually viable on any kind of surface.""
Plus, porousness is a good thing when it comes to avoiding viral transmission. A surface that is permeable, like a fabric, tends to trap viruses more easily than hard surfaces.
""It's less at risk of transmitting because the virus gets kind of stuck to the [porous] surface, and so it can't be easily transferred back off of it,"" Graham says. ""Porous surfaces also suck the fluid out of it. The viral membrane is a lipid membrane, and so if that becomes dried out, it's basically done, infectivity-wise.""
If you are concerned that clothing or other fabric items might have picked up the virus, throw the clothing in the washer and dryer. For most situations, says Graham, your detergent will do its job and get rid of any infective particles — or at least sanitize them to the point where they're not a risk to you.
If you're taking care of someone who is ill or immunocompromised or if you're working in a health care setting, you may want to take additional precautions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommendations for households with suspected or confirmed cases of the coronavirus, which include wearing gloves when handling dirty laundry from an ill person and using the warmest appropriate water setting when washing clothes or linens to disinfect them.
I like to use wipes to disinfect surfaces in my home — especially surfaces that are frequently touched. But how much surface area can one wipe be used on before it loses its ability to kill the coronavirus?
The first step is to check the label on the wipes you're using. For instance, the label on a container of Clorox wipes instructs: ""Use enough wipes for treated surface to remain visibly wet for 4 minutes. To kill viruses, let stand 15 seconds.""
That time and that visible wetness are important, says Erica Hartmann, an expert in environmental microbiology at Northwestern University's McCormick School of Engineering.
Regardless of the particular ingredients in the wipes you're using, ""they're all chemicals that have to react,"" she says. ""And those chemical reactions aren't instantaneous — they take a certain amount of time. So what you're doing when you're keeping the surface wet is you're basically allowing time, allowing the chemical reactions to take place.""
So if that Clorox wipe isn't making the surface visibly wet for 4 minutes, you're trying to cover too much ground with one wipe.
There's no exact figure for how much surface area a wipe can handle. But a 2018 study found that one wipe is generally more effective over 1 to 2 square feet than 8 square feet.
And you don't need a premade wipe to clean surfaces: You can also use a liquid product on a cloth or paper towel. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises using products that contain bleach (sodium hypochlorite) or alcohol (at least 70%) and following the manufacturer's directions. You can make your own cleaning solution by mixing 4 teaspoons of bleach per quart of water, according to the CDC.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has posted a list of approved products to disinfect against the coronavirus.
Strangers keep petting my dog when we go for a walk. Could my dog transmit the virus on its fur?
Saskia Popescu, an infection prevention epidemiologist at the health care system HonorHealth, says she's not especially concerned about dog fur transmitting the virus. ""I think that I would probably be more worried if somebody was coughing all over the place and went to touch my dog's harness or something — something inanimate,"" she says. ""I would put it in the lower-risk category.""
That's because like fabric, fur is a porous surface — so it isn't easy for a person to pick up bits of virus from it. ""The chances of you getting it from fur and hair is going to be less than getting it from a solid surface,"" says Graham, the virologist. Still, she said, she would err on the side of caution and ask people not to pet your dog right now.
Graham says one way to make sure your dog doesn't get touched by overenthusiastic petters is to avoid letting your dog off leash in a place where it may encounter other people. Rather than going to a dog park, she says, ""it might be a better idea to take your dog out in the yard or somewhere you know that there's not going to be a lot of people.""
And despite the occasional media report of a dog diagnosed with COVID-19, there is no evidence that pets can contract or spread COVID-19. The CDC says it has not received any reports of pets or animals becoming sick with the disease. The American Veterinary Medical Association concurs: ""Infectious disease experts and multiple international and domestic human and animal health organizations agree there is no evidence at this point to indicate that pets become ill with COVID-19 or that they spread it to other animals, including people.""
One note: If you are already sick with COVID-19, the association recommends limiting contact with animals ""out of an abundance of caution"" until more is known about the virus. If you're not sick with the coronavirus, the group says you can interact with your pet as you normally would — while practicing good hygiene, including washing your hands before and after interacting with your pet."

They are called ""surrogates"". Because nCoV is new, we don't have any studies, so we need to estimate it's behavior from previously studied similar viruses.

Here:

RH   = Relative Humidity. 
Tr   = Room Temperature
TGEV = Transmissible Gastroenteritis (surrogate)
MHV  = Mouse Hepatitis (surrogate)


Viral survival for the TGEV/MHV surrogate:


on stainless steel:      4°C @ 20% RH:  28 days
in water/sewage (TGEV):  25°C: 22 days
in water/sewage (MHV):   25°C: 17 days
contaminated water is a potential vehicle for exposure if aerosols are generated


For airborne Human Coronavirus 229E (HCV/229E):


Optimal survival:  6°C @ 50% RH: 
Poor* survival:     20°C @ ""High"" relative humidity (RH)
(* ""poor"" in terms of 20°C but varying RH.)


For SARS CoV-P9:


Serum: 96 h = 4 days
Sputum &amp; Feces: 96 h = 4 days
Urine: 72 h = 3 days


For SARS-CoV (GVU6109):


in diarrheal stool (at low pH): 4 days
in respiratory/air droplets:  >7  days @ 20°C (Tr)
in respiratory/air droplets:  >20 days @ 4°C



  ""The main route of transmission of SARS CoV infection is presumed to be respiratory droplets. However the virus is also detectable in other body fluids and excreta. The stability of the virus at different temperatures and relative humidity on smooth surfaces were studied. The dried virus on smooth surfaces retained its viability for over 5 days at temperatures of 22–25°C and relative humidity of 40–50%, that is, typical air-conditioned environments. However, virus viability was rapidly lost (>3 log10) at higher temperatures and higher relative humidity (e.g., 38°C, and relative humidity of >95%).""
  
  ""We and others have reported that infectivity of SARS CoV (SARS coronavirus) was lost after heating at 56°C for 15 minutes but that it was stable for at least 2 days following drying on plastic.""




UPDATE: 2020-03-13

From [7]: 


  ""We found that viable virus could be detected in aerosols up to 3 hours 
  post aerosolization, up to 4 hours on copper, up to 24 hours on 
  cardboard and up to 2-3 days on plastic and stainless steel. HCoV-19 and 
  SARS-CoV-1 exhibited similar half-lives in aerosols, with median 
  estimates around 2.7 hours. Both viruses show relatively long viability 
  on stainless steel and polypropylene compared to copper or cardboard: 
  the median half-life estimate for HCoV-19 is around 13 hours on steel 
  and around 16 hours on polypropylene. Our results indicate that aerosol 
  and fomite transmission of HCoV-19 is plausible, as the virus can remain 
  viable in aerosols for multiple hours and on surfaces up to days.""


For SARS-CoV-2:
Experiments were performed @ 40% RH and 21-23°C.


Copper (Cu):      4 hours
Stainless (Fe):   48 hours (2 days)
Cardboard:        24 hours 
Plastic:          72 hours (3 days)
SARS-CoV-2 is most stable on plastic and stainless steel.

1) High humidity leads to condensation of sneezing cough saliva particles sooner, so it does not spread to farther distance

2) Low humidity leads to less condensation and higher range of movement of saliva particle, hence more spread area.

Apparently it has to do with physics and range of infection not on survivability.

In reference to the stability of the virus outside the body for SARS-CoV, the WHO consensus document said:


  Data from the Chinese University in Hong Kong indicated that SARS-CoV has
  been isolated from stool on paper, a Formica surface and a plastered wall after 36 hours, on a plastic surface and stainless steel after 72 hours, and after 96 hours on a glass slide.
  Hospital environmental samples from a number of sites, including walls and the ventilation
  system, tested PCR positive in Canada.


A later follow-up confirmed that SARS-CoV is viable possibly for days in the right conditions:


  In the present study, we have demonstrated that SARS CoV can survive at least two weeks after drying at temperature and humidity conditions found in an air-conditioned environment. The virus is stable for 3 weeks at room temperature in a liquid environment1


1Chan, K. H., Peiris, J. S., Lam, S. Y., Poon, L. L. M., Yuen, K. Y., &amp; Seto, W. H. (2011). The effects of temperature and relative humidity on the viability of the SARS coronavirus. Advances in virology, 2011.

This suggests that SARS-CoV was better at surviving in the environment than other related strains, especially in cool temperatures. However, there was still a substantial decrease in viral titre by 1 week.

For MERS-CoV,


  MERS-CoV virus could still be recovered after 48 hours2


...on plastic and steel surfaces, though not at 72 hours, at 20C. The virus degraded more quickly at higher temperatures.

2Van Doremalen, N., Bushmaker, T., &amp; Munster, V. J. (2013). Stability of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) under different environmental conditions. Eurosurveillance, 18(38), 20590.



Assuming the new 2019-nCoV virus is similar to these, there is a risk of environmental transmission particularly in high-exposure locations like hospitals. It seems far less likely to be a risk after multiple weeks, but there is still little known about the new strain.

I was unable to find more than speculation about rates of actual infection due to exposure in these conditions, but that speculation is mostly focused on the health care setting and in particular on transmission in health care settings despite extensive precautions.

It's very difficult to connect culture viability to actual transmission risks, and not really ethical to swipe different concentrations of a coronavirus on the surfaces of a room and let people wander through to see how many get sick. Therefore, the best evidence for surface transmission of these viruses is when other methods of exposure can be mostly ruled out, and this is a very imperfect estimate.

Your cat wont get FIP by being with an FIP + cat, it can however contract coronavirus. And yes as you mentioned, not all coronavirus cats will develop FIP.

From my ""Common Diseases of Companion Animals"" textbook:


  80% to 90% of cats in catteries have antibodies to FECV and these cats shed virus intermittently.


That being said by continuously disinfecting and only having one/two cat(s) in your home you can eventually clear out FECV (most common household disinfectants work).

You can check your current cat what his current anti-body levels are for coronavirus if you're concerned about a new cat coming in as well.

An excerpt from veterinary partner on FECV:


  An active infection lasts several weeks to a few months. Virus is shed in the infected cat’s stool during this period. If the cat is reinfected, virus sheds again for weeks to months. During this time, the cat may or may not seems at all ill. Some infected cats do not shed virus.
  
  The mutation to a form of virus that can cause FIP is more likely to occur in an immune-compromised cat. Most cats with FIP are less than one year old (their immaturity is their immune compromise). Crowding is also an important source of immune-compromise. Another important factor in mutation is multiple exposure/infections. When cats keep getting reinfected, the virus they carry has more chance of mutating to a form that causes FIP.


I've only seen 3 cases of FIP in almost 4 years in practice, it's not very common.

  “Are there viruses that infect plants that can mutate to infect
  humans?”


Answer

None appear to have been reported so far. It is difficult to provide supporting evidence for an assertion that they do not exist, but a recent review on the relationship between plant and animal viromes does not include any examples, and our general understanding of the mechanisms by which viruses infect organisms and cells suggest that this is unlikely. There are, however, examples of plant viruses replicating in the insect vectors that transmit them.

Evidence

In 2011 Dolja and Koonin of the NIH published a review in Current Opinion in Virology 1 322-331 entitled Common origins and host-dependent diversity of plant and animal viromes. In this they considered: 


  “…three distinct scenarios for the origin of related viruses of plants
  and animals: i) evolution from a common ancestral virus predating the
  divergence of plants and animals; ii) horizontal transfer of viruses,
  for example, through insect vectors; iii) parallel origin from related
  genetic elements.”


The very fact that there was a need to argue for a relationship indicates the assumed distinction between animal and plant viruses, and indeed they write:


  “…plants are not known to support reproduction of dsDNA viruses and
  retroviruses.”


The only reference in the whole article to an actual biological relationship between animal and plant viruses is the following:


  “Strikingly, viruses of the order Mononegavirales and the family
  Bunyaviridae… can also reproduce in their arthropod vectors.”


The paper referenced in support of this statement is by Hogenhout et al. and was published in the Annual Review of Phytophathology (2008) 46 327–359, and is entitled Insect Vector Interactions with Persistently Transmitted Viruses. From this it emerges that there is a class of plant viruses called persistent propogative viruses which replicate in the circulation of their insect vectors, in contrast to most types of circulative viruses. The insects involved include the leafhopper (illustrated below in Fig 1 from that review) and the thrip.



Schematic representation of persistent virus transmission by a leafhopper. Viruses that are transmitted in a circulative persistent manner do not replicate in the insect and usually enter the salivary glands from the hemolymph. In plants, replication of circulative viruses is frequently restricted to the phloem tissues. In contrast, most propagative viruses replicate in several plant tissues and in different organs of the insect vectors ( yellow arrows) and may enter the salivary glands either from the hemolymph or from other connecting tissues, e.g., the nervous system or trachea. 

It is not clear to me whether the virus is in any way detremental to the insect vector — certainly it is not the primary target of the virus, and replication can be regarded as allowing it to survive longer before the insect transmits it to the plant.

Today insects, tomorrow people?

The very fact that persistent propogative insect viruses can replicate in their animal vectors raises the question whether the insects could somehow transmit them to human beings. In an answer to a different question on whether insect pathogens can infect humans I have argued that the absence of examples in situations where people come into close contact with insects and the  difference in anatomy and molecular structure of cell membranes makes this unlikely. In the present case we are not even talking about an insect pathogen, but a plant pathogen.

That is the time the virus takes to be at 99% of it's original concentration. (from ""survival of surrogate coronavirus in water"").

Viruses can also spread via swimming pools, i.e. hepatitus A and norovirus have been associated with swimming pools. (from ""a review of waterborne viral deseases associated with swimming pools"").

Boiling water will kill viruses. Children have very little reaction to the virus when they carry it, so it's likely that they act as a transmitter more than water does. I'm not worried about it at all by the way, just do what the doctors advise.

  According to the authorities, some patients were operating dealers or
  vendors in the Huanan Seafood market. Based on the preliminary
  information from the Chinese investigation team, no evidence of
  significant human-to-human transmission and no health care worker
  infections have been reported.


They also note that all patients are being isolated, and that close contacts of patients are being identified and monitored, which indicates that this avenue was being investigated.

Further advice published on 10th January also indicated that:


  From the currently available information, preliminary investigation
  suggests that there is no significant human-to-human transmission, and
  no infections among health care workers have occurred.


But again, warned that travellers should take measures such as


  
  avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections;
  frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment;
  travellers with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover coughs and sneezes
  with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).
  


According to the WHO COVID-19 Timeline's entry for January 14th:


  Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove noted in a press briefing there had been
  limited human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus (in the 41
  confirmed cases), mainly through family members, and that there was a
  risk of a possible wider outbreak. Dr. Kerkhove noted that
  human-to-human transmission would not be surprising given our
  experience with SARS, MERS and other respiratory pathogens.


After WHO officials from its China and Western Pacific regional offices conducted a brief field visit to Wuhan from the 20th-21st of Jan, the latter office published a twitter thread on January 21st stating that as a result of the increasing number of cases of the virus; ""It is now very clear [...] that there is at least some human-to-human transmission of #nCoV2019"". The thread also states that ""more information and analysis are needed on this new virus to understand the full extent of human-to-human transmission and other important details"". 

Additionally, on the 21st of January, the DON for the spread of the disease in the Republic of Korea contained the phrase ""the extent of human-to-human transmission"", the first DON not to question the existence of human-to-human transmission, but rather its extent.

A more formal announcement was made by the WHO mission to China on the 22nd of January which states that:


  Data collected through detailed epidemiological investigation and
  through the deployment of the new test kit nationally suggests that
  human-to-human transmission is taking place in Wuhan. More analysis of
  the epidemiological data is needed to understand the full extent of
  human-to-human transmission. WHO stands ready to provide support to
  China to conduct further detailed analysis.


In conclusion then, while human-to-human transmission was suspected to be present from the initial WHO DON on January 5th, this was not confirmed until after data observed in the field in Wuhan by members of the WHO China &amp; Western Pacific regional offices was thought to show that human-to-human transmission was clearly a factor. These field investigations took place on the 20th-21st of January, and announcements acknowledging this conclusion were first made on the 21st.

Dr. Angela Rogers, a pulmonologist at the Stanford University Medical Center and chair of its intensive care unit's COVID-19 task force, notes that Tylenol is the go-to medication for patients who are sick enough to be hospitalized for any infection. That's because these patients are at higher risk of damage to internal organs, including kidneys. And kidney damage can be a side effect of ibuprofen for some patients who use it long-term in higher doses, says Rogers, whose research focuses on the kind of acute respiratory distress experienced by the most severe COVID-19 cases.
Tylenol, like any medicine, isn't risk-free either; Rogers notes that acetaminophen can cause serious liver damage in high doses. In low doses, though, she says, Tylenol is ""very effective"" for reducing fever and ""very safe."""

Of course the immune system has an actual job besides causing nuisance inflammation: fighting infection.

For some infections, the harm to the infected person caused by the immune reaction itself is worse than that of the pathogen itself, so steroids can help prevent damage or ease symptoms while the immune system continues to mount a response, without being hyperactive.

For others, immune suppression may be detrimental. 

Corticosteroids mediate the immune response by suppressing a variety of cytokines and increasing others, which influences activity circulating numbers of different immune cell populations. Cortisol binds the glucocorticoid receptor, causing numerous changes in gene expression, many of which are associated with the immune system. From Wikipedia:


  (cortisol) inhibits production of interleukin (IL)-12, interferon (IFN)-gamma, IFN-alpha, and tumor-necrosis-factor (TNF)-alpha by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and T helper (Th)1 cells, but upregulates IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 by Th2 cells. This results in a shift toward a Th2 immune response rather than general immunosuppression. The activation of the stress system (and resulting increase in cortisol and Th2 shift) seen during an infection is believed to be a protective mechanism which prevents an over-activation of the inflammatory response.


In other words, corticosteroids work by by suppressing the generalized killing/cleanup part of the immune system mediated by macrophages and CD8+ cells, while preserving the B-cell part of the immune system that produces specific antibodies and the neutrophils that phagocytose antibody- and complement-bound pathogens.

Immune reactions are incredibly complex, so some of these basics may be violated in certain circumstances (including prolonged rather than acute dosing), and I've left out a lot of the other related immune cells. See references below (and the Wikipedia pages linked above) for more:

  One antiviral-drug candidate is a combination of the HIV protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir. Lopinavir, which acts against the viral 3CL protease, has modest antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.


A quick search shows that SARS-CoV 3CL protease was the topic of some more in-depth investigations, including a theoretical Thai study of how of lopinavir might act on the 3CLpro of SARS:


  it was found that a mixture of two HIV-1 proteinase inhibitors, lopinavir and ritonavir, exhibited some signs of effectiveness against the SARS virus. To understand the fine details of the molecular interactions between these proteinase inhibitors and the SARS virus via complexation, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for the SARS-CoV 3CLpro free enzyme (free SARS) and its complexes with lopinavir (SARS–LPV) and ritonavir (SARS–RTV). The results show that flap closing was clearly observed when the inhibitors bind to the active site of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. 
  
  [From:] Nukoolkarn et al. ""Molecular dynamic simulations analysis of ritronavir and lopinavir as SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors"" J Theor Biol. 


It's ""above my pay grade"" to comment whether that makes any sense or not as a practical approach to SARS (or Covid-19) medication, but the paper  notes that lopinavir has a similar effect on the HIV protease:


  Similarly, this kind of flap (loop) closing was also observed when inhibitors bind in the active site of HIV-1 protease (Hornak et al., 2006a, Hornak et al., 2006b).


As noted on Protopedia


  Drugs that inhibit HIV protease prevent the virus from replicating, and are crucial components of anti-HIV therapies.
  
  The proteolytic active site of HIV protease is covered by two ""flaps"". It is believed that these flaps must open to enable substrate polyprotein to enter the active site. Drugs that inhibit HIV protease tend to ""lock"" the flaps closed.


So I think they were/are hoping that 3CL plays a similarly vital role for SARS and Covid-19 virus replications, and so that drugs that close it will inhibit virus replication.

There seem to be other researchers who have considered this approach for the SARS-CoVs, so perhaps it has some merit:


  One promising approach is to develop small molecule inhibitors of the essential major polyprotein processing protease 3Clpro. Here we report a complete description of the tetrapeptide substrate specificity of 3Clpro using fully degenerate peptide libraries consisting of all 160,000 possible naturally occurring tetrapeptides. 


There's even a library-compound-search paper like that (i.e. trying to find molecules that would inhibit its 3CL) for SARS-CoV-2 out already (published March 26) by Chinese and Saudi researchers:


  The viral 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) enzyme controls coronavirus replication and is essential for its life cycle. 3CLpro is a proven drug discovery target in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Recent studies revealed that the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to that of SARS-CoV. Therefore, herein, we analysed the 3CLpro sequence, constructed its 3D homology model, and screened it against a medicinal plant library containing 32,297 potential anti-viral phytochemicals/traditional Chinese medicinal compounds. Our analyses revealed that the top nine hits might serve as potential anti- SARS-CoV-2 lead molecules for further optimisation and drug development process to combat COVID-19.


However, this latter paper also notes that there are some key differences between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 3CL proteases, so compounds that work against one might not be so effective against the other:


  results revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro receptor-binding pocket conformation resembles that of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro binding pocket and raises the possibility that inhibitors intended for SARS-CoV 3CLpro may also inhibit the activity of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro.
  
  To test this hypothesis, we docked (R)-N-(4-(tert-butyl)phenyl)-N-(2-(tert-butylamino)-2-oxo-1-(pyridin-3-yl)ethyl)furan-2-carboxamide), a potential noncovalent inhibitor of SARS-CoV 3CLpro named ML188 [35], with the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro homology model. We also docked ML188 with the SARS-CoV 3CLpro structure (PDB ID: 3M3V) as a reference, and ML188 bound strongly to the receptor binding site of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The inhibitor targets the Cys-His catalytic dyad (Cys-145 and His-41) along with the other residues, and the docking score (S = −12.27) was relatively high. However, surprisingly, ML188 did not show significant binding to the catalytic dyad (Cys-145 and His-41) of SARS-CoV-2, and the docking score (S = −8.31) was considerably lower (Fig. S3). 


This paper also investigated (in the theoretical/computational sense) three other drugs of that kind that might work on the SARS-CoV-2 3CL: Nelfinavir, Prulifloxacin and Colistin. Nelfinavir is also a protease inhibitor used to treat HIV-1 and Wikipedia says it's also being investigated for COVID-19, but I haven't checked the details. Interestingly perhaps, lopinavir is not mentioned at all in this SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor screening study. I couldn't tell you exactly why, but it might be because there are at least six ""1st gen"" protease inhibitors used in HIV treatment (and some ""2nd gen"" ones) so they probably just picked one for this study as representative.

The notion that such a link exists was sparked last weekend when a tweet by the French health minister warned people not to take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs because some French COVID-19 patients had experienced serious side effects. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, or Nsaids, could aggravate symptoms of the coronavirus, and suggested that people take acetaminophen instead.  Because the coronavirus is a new pathogen, there is not a lot known on how patients respond to common medications, but other experts pushed back on the French minister’s warning.  Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus. The vaccines simply guardagainst those specific bacterial infections.The COVID-19 virus can, in fact, cause pneumonia, but the vaccines cannot prevent this pneumonia. Aciclovir specifically targets HSV-family viruses. It is metabolized by a viral-specific enzyme into an inhibitor of the specific DNA polymerase expressed by the virus. Other viruses don't express these specific enzymes, and even if they have similar enzymes they may not interact the same way with the drug. Even within the herpesvirus family, the drug is not equally effective against every virus. Coronaviruses are RNA viruses, so even though the drug is not effective for DNA viruses outside the herpesvirus family, coronaviruses are definitely not going to be affected because they don't even have a DNA polymerase to inhibit. One of the primary purposes of corticosteroids is to suppress immune activity and inflammation: that's exactly why they are used in asthma. Without trial data your question can not be answered.

India has, according to the WHO's World malaria report 2019, the largest proportion of malaria cases outside of Africa:


  Nineteen countries in sub-Saharan Africa and India carried almost
  85% of the global malaria burden.


The report also notes that India is the only one of the ""high burden to high impact"" countries (basically countries most affected by malaria) to have significant domestic investment into dealing with the disease compared to the reliance on international aid. This has manifested itself in the form of pharmaceutical manufacturers which can supply India with its domestic demand for the drug, such as Zydus Cadila and Ipca Laboratories.

This Forbes article notes that these companies in particular have significant capacity to ramp up production:


  “The priority is to manufacture this drug versus anything else,” says
  Sharvil Patel, managing director at Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila,
  which had $1.9 billion in revenues in fiscal 2019. “We have ramped up
  our production of hydroxychloroquine from 3 metric tons per month to
  20 to 30 metric tons per month and can scale it up further to 40 to 50
  metric tons if there is a requirement.”
  
  Ipca Labs, which has 20-metric-ton capacity, can produce 100 million
  tablets a month. “The Indian government has placed a significant
  order,” says Ajit Kumar Jain, joint managing director of Ipca Labs.
  “We can increase our manufacturing capacity to 26 metric tons in a
  month or two. We are also simultaneously ramping up our packing and
  labelling lines.”
  
  [...]
  
  Sudarshan Jain, secretary general of the Indian Pharmaceutical
  Alliance, an industry group, says that “the domestic demand is 3
  million tablets a month but we have the capacity to go up to 150
  million to 200 million tablets a month easily.” He adds that “it is
  very difficult to predict demand going forward because we do not know
  how many will be affected.”


This is, of course, on top of the underlying fact that India is, according to Raconteur, the largest provider of generic drugs globally, with its pharmaceutical industry is growing by 7 to 8 per cent a year, with growth of 11 to 13 percent expected in 2020.

It seems that India's prominence in the manufacture of the drug is due to existing infrastructure due to high existing domestic demand, and a strong underlying pharmaceutical industry, giving it the ability to quickly scale up production levels.

  Considering today's assertion that FDA has now approved certain pharms, does it follow that these prescriptions are no longer ""off-label"", but rather are indicated uses?


No.  The president is not the FDA, and the president's statements about FDA actions are not FDA actions.  The only official source of information about drug approvals is the FDA's list of approved drugs.  See 21 CFR 314.3:


  Listed drug is a new drug product that has been approved under section 505(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for safety and effectiveness or under section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which has not been withdrawn or suspended under section 505(e)(1) through (5) or section 505(j)(6) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and which has not been withdrawn from sale for what FDA has determined are reasons of safety or effectiveness. Listed drug status is evidenced by the drug product's identification in the current edition of FDA's “Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations” (the list) as an approved drug. A drug product is deemed to be a listed drug on the date of approval for the NDA or ANDA for that drug product.
