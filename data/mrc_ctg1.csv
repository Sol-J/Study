how is covid dangerous,"More deadly than the flu. Although scientists won’t know for sure until testing becomes widespread, COVID-19 could be about 10 times more deadly than the seasonal flu, which leads to death in about 0.1% of those it infects, says Donald N. Forthal, MD, professor of medicine and molecular biology and biochemistry, and chief of infectious diseases at UCI School of Medicine.

Researchers also don’t have accurate enough numbers to determine the actual percentage of deaths that result from this viral infection, given that there are a great many mild cases, as well as deaths, that have gone unreported.

But Forthal expects the mortality rate to be lower than what we’re seeing today in hotspots around the globe once the data are finally collected.

It’s not the most contagious virus, either.

Michael J. Buchmeier, PhD, professor of infectious diseases at UCI School of Medicine, explains that this virus, while deadly, is thought to be about as contagious as the seasonal flu, with one person infecting another two or three.

Contrast that with measles, where one person can infect 18, or chicken pox, where one person can infect 12. But these two highly contagious diseases are controlled by vaccination.

No one is immune
But it is a virus that has never been seen in humans, so absolutely no one is immune to it. That added to the fact that it spreads as easily from person to person as influenza, and infects the upper respiratory system, is what makes it so dangerous. Plus there is no vaccine.

Because the COVID-19 virus is found in the upper airway — including the mouth and nose — the infection can be spread through coughs, sneezes, huffing and puffing, and likely even loud talking, according to Forthal.

Moreover, we are learning that infected people are unknowingly spreading the virus days before they begin to experience symptoms. Some may not experience symptoms at all.

Neither SARS nor MERS spread as easily or widely.

This new virus ""is capable of causing very severe disease,” Buchmeier says. "

are sars cov and covid related,"Stickier than SARS-1
The virus that causes COVID-19 is similar to SARS — in fact, it’s officially called SARS-CoV-2 — and it attaches to the same receptors as SARS-CoV-1, but it’s stickier, Buchmeier explains. That allows the virus to enter cells more quickly, get a firmer grasp and begin spreading more quickly throughout the body.

This virus also attacks the lower respiratory tract — the bronchial tubes and the lungs — where it can lead to pneumonia.

That triggers an inflammatory response as the body attempts to fight the invader. In some people — about 15% — this immune response starts a cyclical overreaction of the body’s immune system called a cytokine storm.

“Cytokine production is a normal immune response to try to kill the virus,” Forthal says. “Under normal circumstances, the response peaks early, clears the virus and helps produce antibodies and T cells specific for the virus. But in some COVID-19 patients, the cytokine response sticks around too long and too strongly.”

“You not only get severe damage to the lungs, which may or may not be directly attributable to the virus,” says Forthal. “But the cytokine storm also can contribute to coagulopathy [clot formation], kidney damage and heart damage.”

This is what’s causing some people to become severely ill or die, Forthal says. Researchers have seen other coronaviruses provoke similar cytokine overreactions."

But in some COVID-19 patients, the cytokine response sticks around too long and too strongly.”

“You not only get severe damage to the lungs, which may or may not be directly attributable to the virus,” says Forthal. “But the cytokine storm also can contribute to coagulopathy [clot formation], kidney damage and heart damage.”

This is what’s causing some people to become severely ill or die, Forthal says. Researchers have seen other coronaviruses provoke similar cytokine overreactions."
how does covid compare to other viruses,"Stickier than SARS-1
The virus that causes COVID-19 is similar to SARS — in fact, it’s officially called SARS-CoV-2 — and it attaches to the same receptors as SARS-CoV-1, but it’s stickier, Buchmeier explains. That allows the virus to enter cells more quickly, get a firmer grasp and begin spreading more quickly throughout the body.

This virus also attacks the lower respiratory tract — the bronchial tubes and the lungs — where it can lead to pneumonia.

besides covid testing how do you distinguish between the flu and covid,"The speed of transmission is an important point of difference between the two viruses. Influenza has a shorter median incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of symptoms) and a shorter serial interval (the time between successive cases) than COVID-19 virus. The serial interval for COVID-19 virus is estimated to be 5-6 days, while for influenza virus, the serial interval is 3 days. This means that influenza can spread faster than COVID-19. 

Further, transmission in the first 3-5 days of illness, or potentially pre-symptomatic transmission –transmission of the virus before the appearance of symptoms – is a major driver of transmission for influenza. In contrast, while we are learning that there are people who can shed COVID-19 virus 24-48 hours prior to symptom onset, at present, this does not appear to be a major driver of transmission. 

The reproductive number – the number of secondary infections generated from one infected individual – is understood to be between 2 and 2.5 for COVID-19 virus, higher than for influenza. However, estimates for both COVID-19 and influenza viruses are very context and time-specific, making direct comparisons more difficult.  

Children are important drivers of influenza virus transmission in the community. For COVID-19 virus, initial data indicates that children are less affected than adults and that clinical attack rates in the 0-19 age group are low. Further preliminary data from household transmission studies in China suggest that children are infected from adults, rather than vice versa.

While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar, the fraction with severe disease appears to be different. For COVID-19, data to date suggest that 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe infection, requiring oxygen and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation. These fractions of severe and critical infection would be higher than what is observed for influenza infection.

Those most at risk for severe influenza infection are children, pregnant women, elderly, those with underlying chronic medical conditions and those who are immunosuppressed. For COVID-19, our current understanding is that older age and underlying conditions increase the risk for severe infection.

Mortality for COVID-19 appears higher than for influenza, especially seasonal influenza. While the true mortality of COVID-19 will take some time to fully understand, the data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases) is between 3-4%, the infection mortality rate (the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infections) will be lower. For seasonal influenza, mortality is usually well below 0.1%. However, mortality is to a large extent determined by access to and quality of health care. "

Those most at risk for severe influenza infection are children, pregnant women, elderly, those with underlying chronic medical conditions and those who are immunosuppressed. For COVID-19, our current understanding is that older age and underlying conditions increase the risk for severe infection.

Mortality for COVID-19 appears higher than for influenza, especially seasonal influenza. While the true mortality of COVID-19 will take some time to fully understand, the data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases) is between 3-4%, the infection mortality rate (the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infections) will be lower. For seasonal influenza, mortality is usually well below 0.1%. However, mortality is to a large extent determined by access to and quality of health care. "
what is the difference between seasonal flu and covid,"The speed of transmission is an important point of difference between the two viruses. Influenza has a shorter median incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of symptoms) and a shorter serial interval (the time between successive cases) than COVID-19 virus. The serial interval for COVID-19 virus is estimated to be 5-6 days, while for influenza virus, the serial interval is 3 days. This means that influenza can spread faster than COVID-19. 

Further, transmission in the first 3-5 days of illness, or potentially pre-symptomatic transmission –transmission of the virus before the appearance of symptoms – is a major driver of transmission for influenza. In contrast, while we are learning that there are people who can shed COVID-19 virus 24-48 hours prior to symptom onset, at present, this does not appear to be a major driver of transmission. 

The reproductive number – the number of secondary infections generated from one infected individual – is understood to be between 2 and 2.5 for COVID-19 virus, higher than for influenza. However, estimates for both COVID-19 and influenza viruses are very context and time-specific, making direct comparisons more difficult.  

Children are important drivers of influenza virus transmission in the community. For COVID-19 virus, initial data indicates that children are less affected than adults and that clinical attack rates in the 0-19 age group are low. Further preliminary data from household transmission studies in China suggest that children are infected from adults, rather than vice versa.

While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar, the fraction with severe disease appears to be different.

While the true mortality of COVID-19 will take some time to fully understand, the data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases) is between 3-4%, the infection mortality rate (the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infections) will be lower. For seasonal influenza, mortality is usually well below 0.1%. However, mortality is to a large extent determined by access to and quality of health care. "
will the covid be as bad as the 1918 spanish flu pandemic that infected 500000000 people,"The speed of transmission is an important point of difference between the two viruses. Influenza has a shorter median incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of symptoms) and a shorter serial interval (the time between successive cases) than COVID-19 virus. The serial interval for COVID-19 virus is estimated to be 5-6 days, while for influenza virus, the serial interval is 3 days. This means that influenza can spread faster than COVID-19. 

Further, transmission in the first 3-5 days of illness, or potentially pre-symptomatic transmission –transmission of the virus before the appearance of symptoms – is a major driver of transmission for influenza. In contrast, while we are learning that there are people who can shed COVID-19 virus 24-48 hours prior to symptom onset, at present, this does not appear to be a major driver of transmission. 

The reproductive number – the number of secondary infections generated from one infected individual – is understood to be between 2 and 2.5 for COVID-19 virus, higher than for influenza. However, estimates for both COVID-19 and influenza viruses are very context and time-specific, making direct comparisons more difficult.  

Children are important drivers of influenza virus transmission in the community. For COVID-19 virus, initial data indicates that children are less affected than adults and that clinical attack rates in the 0-19 age group are low. Further preliminary data from household transmission studies in China suggest that children are infected from adults, rather than vice versa.

While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar, the fraction with severe disease appears to be different. For COVID-19, data to date suggest that 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe infection, requiring oxygen and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation. These fractions of severe and critical infection would be higher than what is observed for influenza infection.

Those most at risk for severe influenza infection are children, pregnant women, elderly, those with underlying chronic medical conditions and those who are immunosuppressed. For COVID-19, our current understanding is that older age and underlying conditions increase the risk for severe infection.
