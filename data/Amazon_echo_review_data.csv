There is deal-breaking flaw/bug that prohibits using this way: Unfortunately, the ""line in"" (from the computer) seems to ""go to sleep"" after about 5 seconds of silence from the computer. The speaker will ""wake up"" and start playing the line in only after about 1-2 seconds of audio from the computer. This might be fine for listening to music, but is a deal-breaker for a PC speaker. If there is a pause in conference calls, the speaker goes to sleep, and you miss the first 5 seconds when someone resumes talking. You'll miss alerts and alarms, etc. Also the echo won't ""wake up"", if it is only one second of audio. If you leave the audio-in silent for 10-15 minutes, the ""wake up"" time is longer (about 10 seconds of computer sound to wake it up) To troubleshoot, I've installed the latest echo software on the device and have restarted. I've searched the forums, and this seems to be a known issue. It is important for you to know this if you plan to use the Echo 3 in this way. P.S. Also, the sound quality is mediocre.","","Do NOT buy as a PC speaker!","6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFGL5ILHTADYBAVWXSY5XYUEYIGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NFTVP7P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Amazon","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R317IWPIUPRNMW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NFTVP7P","B07NFTVP7P"

More details on our cons, as the pros have been covered by many other reviews. - cannot be set up from ethernet connected PC, requires either mobile app or wifi PC - whisper mode is cool, but rarely works - the volume between ""too soft - can't hear me"" and ""not a whisper - use normal volume"" makes it very hard to get the whisper reply - bummed that the smart home connectivity for Hue bulbs is limited to so few capabilities compared to a dedicated Hue hub We have had several Echos over the years, and this is a replacement for an older generation, and I hope this one avoids the problems we have had with those, because they are now essentially paperweights: - a recent firmware update (sometime in the last 3 months) killed the ability to connect with our router's 5GHz or 2.4GHz wifi, either as an existing, new, or factory reset new device. We had two identical ones, both replaced by these. One went to the garage where it was rarely used, noticed it was not connected about 2 weeks ago, but figured it just needed a reboot; however rebooting it didn't reconnect it. I hadn't used it in a while, figured maybe it died from the cold or something. The second was in storage in the house, so I got it out to use instead, and it powered up and connected to wifi fine - I checked weather, etc. to verify it was ok. I left it alone a few hours, it got an update and restarted, and was then in the same boat as the other one - no wifi connection can be made with any combo of settings I can try, but it does connect to the Android app via the Amazon wifi step of setup, so the hardware seems fine. All our newer Echos - Echo Plus, Echo Sub, Echo Show, Echo Show 2, work fine with the same settings. - the Android Alexa app pops up an error message when wifi connectivity fails during setup, which covers the first two input fields on the page (network name and password) and can't be dismissed, making it difficult to edit the form without killing the app - the Android Alexa app flips the phone from standard WiFi to a peer-to-peer Amazon Wi-Fi with the Echo during setup, and killing setup or failing setup leaves the phone unconnected to the internet unless you go back and reselect your normal WiFi network in Android settings - support was free, but very slow (3+ minutes to type each response, I think they were in multiple simultaneous chats), and ineffective - they just followed the flowchart, ignoring what I told them I had already done, and asking the same questions over and over; the only new thing they had me try was the factory reset paperclip button, but it made no difference.","","Hope it lasts","1","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHXCP7QZXE74732B6OA7RL46H7PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NFTVP7P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Amazon","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2T0NXYBTPCTWN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NFTVP7P","B07NFTVP7P"

When you first turn it on, volume is very low for about 10 - 15 seconds, then goes moderate for maybe 5 seconds, then loud, and stays loud. If you tell it to lower volume, just don't know what you will get. You have to walk over to it and turn the volume down and even then, it isn't consistent. Plus I have noticed, my husband has as well, it literally does not want to be turned off. It's about 50/50 that it will actually turn off when you tell it too. A couple of times I have told it to ""stop"" and the volume just got very low. Repeated attempts to turn it off were ignored. After several minutes, I finally shouted angrily at it, no lie, and THEN it turned off completely. Does Alexa now understand emotions as well?? Kind of scary. As far as integration in the Alexa app, essentially nonexistent. You can do the setup via the Alexa app, after that, there's no more volume control, on/off control via the app. DO NOT like that Amazon. Are you listening?? Oh, wait you do listen sometimes....

It does take about 45 Minutes for the Temperature sensor to come online. Then I noticed it is about 1.5F lower then all my other thermometer in the house. This looks to be the case for all 4 units. I didn’t find any way to be able to a-just them to correct the reading. They also seem to take some time to change as far as the reading. If I could give the Pluses a offset to use for the Temperature to correct them! Then I would be very happy with them. Not tried out the Zigbee hub in any of the units yet. I don’t have any devices that talk Zigbee. I like the fact if you have 2 or more Echo Pluses! You can ask what the house Temperature is and it will then give you the average Temperature of the house. I also like the fact I can use the built in Temp to be able to control my ceiling fans through the Bond home fan controller. ** Update 2/13/2019 ** In testing the hub some more found the following The Echo Plus will not read Temps 32 and below. So if you want to get the temp outside on a cold winter day! This will not work. If you have a sensor with a Humidity reading! Again the Echo Plus will not see it at all.

At first, this was an impressive device with great bass and excellent voice responsiveness. However, after about 6 months I noticed it starting to lag in voice recognition, and I had to repeat the wakeup word ""Alexa"" several times before it would respond. I also started to notice that sometimes the sound was a little crackly when playing music. I listen to it daily, often for a couple hours as I work around the house, and I rarely have the volume above 40%. On only a rare few occasions have I ""cranked"" it up to 70%. I don't like things loud, and have pretty sensitive hearing, so 40% is usually quite nice and full sounding. However, as the months continued, I noticed the sound degrading more and more and the overall product began to sound more tinny and sometimes crackle with moderate bass sounds (even at only 40%). Some songs seem to be still ok, but more and more are starting to sound steadily worse. And frequently I have to repeat ""Alexa....Alexa....ALEXA!"" many times, even when I'm only a few feet away before the device responds. My environment has not changed, as it is used in my master bedroom, so I'm not sure why the voice responsiveness would get worse over time...it's supposed to get better as it ""learns"" your voice commands, accent, and speaking style. I have a ""Californian"" accent (which is about as zero of an American accent out there) so I'm very surprised it has lost much of it's voice recognition. In any case, at first I really and truly was impressed with this little unobtrusive speaker. It really has much more power, and was more robust sounding when I first bought it. However, I am very disappointed that it is already starting to lose it's clarity in sound and responsiveness - at under a year old. I guess in this throw away technology society, perhaps I should have expected as much.","","Sadly after less than 10 months, speaker sounds crackly, and voice recognition is hit or miss","","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFKHVYAGJFNJGN7ISWINTLXYHDXQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NFTVP7P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Amazon","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KNZ0W79J8CD1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NFTVP7P","B07NFTVP7P"

Now the New Generation Echo devices with their new speakers are so very good plus so very small that we decided removed our Bose speaker from the dining room. In the kitchen and bedroom, we bought the Echo Shows which they also have great sounding speakers. We almost bought the Sonos One with Alexa, but after comparing them side by side in a show. We bought the Amazon Echo devices based on the equally sound and the better price. We paid $69 for the Echo, $99 for Echo Plus and not $199 for the Sonos. The Echo Shows, We paid $179 which was still cheaper than the Sonos One. Now don’t get us started on the new Bose 500 with Alexa at $399, which barely sound better than the New Generation Echo devices and definitely not worth $300 more. Remind you we own a lot of Bose products and have been fans since 1980.

In comparison, the Echo dot sound was just too poor quality to enjoy without hooking up an auxiliary speaker and so we only used it occasionally.

Each room has the two Gen 3 speakers in stereo mode + sub woofer. The stereo configuration with the sub woofer makes a HUGE difference in the sound quality. The sound is comparable to that of Sonos devices at a fraction of the cost. Setup can be a bit flaky but eventually does work. Whole house audio on Eero mesh wireless is hit or miss but that was a secondary benefit for me. If that is a primary reason for purchasing for you that could take this review to a one star. Sometimes Amazon sees devices on different access points as being available to one another. Sometimes it doesn't. The only thing that really ""gets my goat"" is the lack of gapless playback. Isn't all that important for most listening but when it is important it is a must have. I.e. Pink Floyd, Classical music, Live recordings, white noise recordings. Silence between tracks of audio that is meant to be have no gaps is unacceptable. I've been using digital music since the mid 90's and have always had the option of playing gapless. Yahoo had this down way back then but Amazon can't get it done? It is 2020. Right? Also had to buy two of the Gen 3's from another source because Amazon limits a personal account to purchasing six without switching to a business account. I don't understand why (other than profit) they do that. I'm a retail customer wanting to purchase a reasonable amount of speakers for my personal use. I should have been able to order all eight of my speakers at one time from Amazon.","","Only the lack of Gapless playback keeps this from being a 5 for me","1","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFZPGGX5ZVAKRBTCCGSNR4EKOWQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NFTVP7P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Amazon","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1O0NOHTPG4CJF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NFTVP7P","B07NFTVP7P"

Amazon now gives you the option of doing ""speaker pairing"" that will allow you to connect multiple speakers and use them as one. The problem I'm running into is that if you are dropped in on a ""call"" (one room to another) it only uses one speaker and when you try to hang up it says there is no call connected if the ""other"" speaker heard you tell it to hang up. I love the Amazon Alexa system and I have it throughout my home for home automation and it works great, it can hear you from another room and it understands what you are asking for. There are a TON of devices you can connect to it and there are a TON of skills to use with it. I loved the idea of connecting multiple speakers as one in the master bedroom because of its size but not being able to use both speakers while making a call is not what I was hoping for. I was hoping they would act as one speaker (or a speaker set like a real stereo system) all the time, for everything. Now the worst part... I changed my review from 4 stars to 1 star because of a software update that now forces me to specify which light, power strip, and/or other devices I want to turn on/off. All of my rooms, lights, power strips, etc... are in various groups for a reason. Each light, outlet, and other devices have a unique name (IE: The upstairs hallway lights are named UH-Light, UH-Light2, and UH-Light 3, my smart power strip has unique ports like TV, Monitors, etc..). YESTERDAY (9/18/2019) I was able to walk into a room and say ""Alexa, turn the light on"" (in my home office for example) and it turns the light on, Today (9/19/2019) I'm sitting in my home office and I say ""Alexa turn the light off"" and I get the response ""There are multiple devices that share that name, which one do you want"". The master bedroom - Setup with only lights (MBR-light, or something like that so I can identify it later when adding other stuff), the wife used to say ""Alexa, turn the light off"" because that's what she has always said before going to sleep. Today she can't do that because of Amazon's development team. So I say ""Alexa turn the office light off"" and it turns the ENTIRE OFFICE GROUP OFF. So now I have to go to the app to turn the light off and rename EVERY ONE OF MY DEVICES so that my family can remember what each name is. I reached out to Amazon customer support who tells me I have to be specific when asking the echo to turn the light off as in ""Alexa, turn the office light off/on"" and that it has always been this way. When I tried to tell them that yesterday I was able to say ""Turn the light off"" they said it wasn't possible and I have always had to be specific. I set up groups for a reason, that being I can go into a room, say ""Alexa, turn the light on"" without having to remember each light bulb name or what I named the room/group. Yes, I know what the group names are, I don't expect everyone in my house to remember the group names. There was a software/firmware update overnight that broke all of my Echo's and Amazon's customer support will not acknowledge it. I will not recommend this device to anyone else until they put it back to the way it was. You would think it would be simple, it's not, apparently. Update 10-8-2019: Attached another picture right from the amazon website that says ""Alexa, turn off the lights"". It's still broken and doesn't work like that. Additionally, I was supposed to receive an email from the Alexa/Echo customer service department with more information, this was a couple weeks ago and I haven't heard anything. They (Amazon) reached out to me after reading my review requesting more information, I gave them everything they needed and the rep said he would contact me again, never happened. It is a pain in the rear end, but this has been broken for nearly a month and nothing has been done about it... I keep getting emails saying ""What's new with Alexa?"" I can tell you what's new, you can't turn the lights off by saying ""Alexa, turn the lights off"". I've done everything the Customer Service Reps have asked me to do, every time it doesn't do what I ask it to do, I go into the app and report it as ""it didn't work correctly"". SORRY AMAZON, YOU ARE FAILING THIS ONE. Update 12/15/2019 - So they fixed the ""Alexa, turn the light off"" for a few days, then it was broken again... Now they've changed the APP so it's more difficult to find the voice responses to give feedback. I tried saying ""Alexa, turn the light off"" got the same response as before ""There are multiple devices with the name light, which one did you want"" If I say ""Alexa, turn the office light off"" it still turns EVERYTHING IN THE OFFICE GROUP OFF"" but Amazon customer support can't seem to get it when I explain that it shouldn't do that. So, like the APP says, I tried saying ""Alexa, turn the lights off"" it responds with ""Sorry, what device"" but I can't say ""Alexa, turn the office lights off"" because it will turn all of the plugs off too, so now Alexa has no voice control over lights if there is anything else in the room. I feel as if I have wasted hundreds of dollars setting this system up for Amazon to come along and ruin it all... Amazon, you should fire your developers and hire people who will do it correctly.","","Connecting multiple speakers isn't 100% functional (Edited to include the turn for the worst)","4","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHAARWFCRJBZQQQY23VT23KQQ2MA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NFTVP7P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Amazon","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RAYOHCBNXKE8P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NFTVP7P","B07NFTVP7P"

Avoid, avoid, avoid, avoid, avoid! --------------------- Original review: The Echo Plus Stereo/Sub pair setup is extremely buggy and unreliable for playing music. The following all happened on the first day of owning this: 1) MOST of the time when I ask for music it only plays through the 1 echo, and NOT the stereo + sub. The only guaranteed way to get stereo + sub is through the Alexa app and not voice command. 2) I'll say ""Alexa stop"" and it'll stop playing music, then I'll say ""Alexa play"" and instead of restarting or playing new music it'll say ""Not currently playing music"" and not play anything. 3) Sometime after starting music it will play at at low volume for 20+ seconds as if Alexa is listening. 4) After pausing music, when I restart it can sometime take 20+ seconds before playback starts. 5) Music has occasionally just stopped playing for no reason, despite having songs left in my queue. 6) Remote doesn't work while music is playing, only when it's not playing. The quality of the sound is very good for the price, and once (if) they fix the bugs it'll be a terrific setup. But the voice command implementation for stereo + sub is poorly implemented and the bugs are extremely frustrating so for now my advice is to stay away. Update: After 3 weeks issue 1 is still happening so dropped to 1 star. Amazon say they're looking into it but unless it's fixed this will stay at 1 star as it's extremely frustrating. Also added a sixth issue above regarding the remote with the stereo/sub pair for those considering buying it. Update 2: After 2 months issues 1, 4, 5 and 6 still occur regularly. Issue 1 can be mitigated by saying ""play on stereo sub pair"" or if it's in a group ""play on <group>"". Note that setting up a group with left and right echos added and the stereo sub pair as the preferred speaker seems to improve things but the issue still occurs. Also found another issue, this time with the multi-room music functionality: If I play on the multi-room setup via the Alexa app and try to interact with Alexa by voice if will often say ""No music playing on this device"" and ignore the instruction. Amazon's customer support have been great as usual trying to help and keeping me up to date with my bug reports, but the team that developed this should be ashamed of themselves, it's poorly implemented and poorly tested. A prime example of rushing the software out and letting the paying public do the beta testing. Fully deserves its single star. Update 3: After testing for the last month I can say issue 1 is now fixed, it hasn't occurred at all recently, and that was by far the most annoying bug. The biggest issues now are: - The sound randomly cutting out midway through a song, the only way to fix is to skip to the next song. - The multi-room setup is flaky, sometimes I'll have the echo in the current room respond, and a few seconds later a linked echo in another room will also respond. - It can still take up to 20 seconds to restart music after pausing. It's slowly getting there but it's been a very frustrating journey, and for that reason I doubt I'll ever go over 4 stars even if everything is fixed. As it is I'm increasing it to 3 stars. Update 4: It's been 7 months. The problem with music suddenly cutting out randomly has come back. I'm done with waiting for fixes, after 7 months it's still flaky. Dropped back to 2 stars. As a software developer with over 20 years experience, I can categorically say that Amazon's developers don't have a clue about developing quality software. Last update: After 10 months my final rating is 1 star. Even after all this time the stereo/sub setup is buggy and frustrating. The Amazon Echo developers are, in a word, incompetent.","","Stereo + sub setup is still buggy after 7 months","3","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGUY7SDJGZD334TW64DTWXB6PYJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NFTVP7P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Amazon","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKHX5P8QRYHJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NFTVP7P","B07NFTVP7P"

I was able to tell her that it did indeed exist and could be in our living room for a mere $99.00. Well, it arrived today and was so easy to set up that I was able to do it without calling in a grandchild to help. My wife and I spent some time requesting songs ranging from the 5th Dimension to Peter, Paul and Mary. She even played me a song from my 1980s Original Soundtrack album. She told us the weather, where squirrels go in the winter, and a couple of dad jokes almost as bad as mine. With all of the novelty I can also see some benefits. I can use this to time my food, to remind me of appointments (which are easy to forget when every day feels like Saturday).

In retrospect, one thing I didn't try, which was an oversight on my part, was a trick I used for the new Kindle Oasis, which has an apparent difficulty with Wi-Fi security. One can create a separate network, with no security. Using a white list approach and the router's control panel, set the network to ONLY accept device specific MAC addresses.

I will say in general that it looks cool, sounds fine (maybe a 5 out of 10 compared to real speakers), the music playing capabilities are excellent with Amazon, Apple, Pandora, and Spotify, and the voice recognition is ok - good not great. I had no problem connecting to a Phillips Hue bulb and eventually an Echo dot and a smart outlet. I use all the time to play music and radio, control lights, and make shopping lists. I bought on sale at the end of 2018 for $97.99 which I think was a great deal. That said, I want to focus in on a four major issues that I wish I’d known about before buying: 1. Podcasts There is no native podcast skill on Alexa so you need to get podcasts through TuneIn, Stitcher, iHeartRadio, etc. All my other devices (computer, mobile) are Apple products where I use the Podcast app to listen and sync. The podcasts I listen to are not all on any one of these skills so I would need to download all the ones I need to keep podcasts synced between Alexa and my iPhone which is too much trouble. Plus I have a heck of the time trying to tell Alexa what podcast I want to listen to - who remembers the episode titles or numbers of the podcast they are currently listening to? Even just asking it to play the latest episode of a podcast wasn’t working for me 9/10 times so I just gave up and figured I will connect my iPhone over Bluetooth when I want to continue a podcast. But that brings me to my next issue: 2. Bluetooth connections I was successful at pairing the Echo to both my iPhone and iPad but Alexa can’t connect to the one I want when I ask it to. If I ask to “connect to my iPhone”, it connects to my iPad. If I ask it to “connect to my phone”, it still connects to my iPad. The only way to get it to connect to my iPhone with a voice command is to turn Bluetooth off on my iPad - annoying! 3. Multiple users This is a big one. It is great that the Echo can have multiple users on it, so my wife and I can share the Echo using our separate accounts which are linked in Prime under the same household. You can even set it up to recognize each of your separate voices. However, ONLY THE PRIMARY ACCOUNT CAN CONTROL THE SMART HOME DEVICES. This means that if I want to control the lights and the Echo is set to use my account, I have to tell it to switch to my wife’s account first, then give it a command for the lights. Furthermore, you have command it to switch between accounts to use your personal skills and settings. Given that it can recognize my voice as distinct from my wife’s, I thought that if I asked to play something on Pandora, it would automatically play from my account. Nope - I need to tell it to switch from my wife’s account to my account, and then ask it to play something on Pandora. Want to turn the lights down? Have to switch back to my wife’s account. Want to play something else on my Pandora? Have to switch back to my account first. What is the point of having voice recognition if it can’t automatically detect who is speaking and use that person’s account? And what is so useful about having multiple accounts if they can’t both control the smart home devices? I can't control the smart home devices from my app, only my wife can, and I can't set up routines either. And last, there are some things I would like to be discrete to my account only - like shopping lists and reminders - but those have to be shared, so my wife’s Alexa app on her phone is getting reminders that I set up. There are some major kinks here they need to work out, but the good news is that it’s all just software fixes so GET ON IT AMAZON! 4. Routines Another big one here. There is a well-documented glitch that people experience with Echos where the music stops playing after one song. You have to ask it to keep playing in order to keep going to the next song. If you google “echo stops playing” you will see lots of discussion around this. Well we had it happen to us as soon as we set up routines. Routines are little scripts you can set up - actions Alexa can take when certain criteria are met. This is one of the primary reasons we went with the Plus instead of the Dot. We have pets in the house and we wanted to set up a routine where the Echo would send us an alert if the house temperature got above or below a certain amount. Well unfortunately as soon as we set up the routines, the Echo started doing the thing where it stops playing after one song. So we deleted the routines and reset the Echo and the problem has not come back. But now I am afraid to set up any routines because I don’t want to deal with the music playback issue. I hope they fix this glitch because not having routines is a big drawback. 5. Alexa Guard I was also excited to learn that the Alexa Guard feature can alert you if it hears broken glass or smoke alarm sounds. But it’s not available yet. Still waiting for that. If I knew someone interested in buying an Echo, I would recommend they try an earlier generation Echo Dot which you can get on craigsist for $20-30 and see how you like that before spending $150 on the latest Echo Plus. Too many bugs still need to be fixed.","","Good overall, but some key features need work!","10","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE7XO2B74ED5KK37Q4CRUPZI3UOQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NFTVP7P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Amazon","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RN0TT7ZIBM7V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NFTVP7P","B07NFTVP7P"

I purchased the echo plus as the zigbee controller due to great voice capabilities as well as last years firmware update that ensured local devices could be controlled if the internet was offline. Initial setup was a breeze, added all the devices without a hitch, renamed them all, created schedules for lights, etc. Also created automation and verbal routines for the devices. Everything worked great for 3 months. Yesterday afternoon, I was notified that voice commands were not working, Alexa was responding with “device not found”. Investigation showed the devices were all mechanically operational and all devices were still registered in the Alexa app. I started by in plugging everything and turning off breakers for the in-wall switches. Nothing worked. Online Support suggested disabling all the devices in the app and then re-enabling them, that did not work. I called support and after about 20 minutes, they suggested I remove all devices, rediscover them and add them back. I let them know I had a large number of these devices and routines setup with all of them, so we tried one. The process worked. The problem when you do that is that you have to modify your groups and routines that previously used that device, because it’s gone now. This was due to a cloud-pushed software update, to a smart home controller that is supposed to operate offline. I was always skeptical about using an Amazon product for such an important function, but was swayed by the attraction of voice control. Never again. No matter how great it sounds or how great the voice pickup is, if it can lose paring to all devices with a remote update, it is not meant for prime time. I will be moving this setup to a non internet smart hub to ensure ADLs are accessible in the future.","","Not for the disabled","","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEM4HGBEWUTAT4UZU3VTHUAGGU3Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NFTVP7P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Amazon","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFXIPC7L2V2MQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NFTVP7P","B07NFTVP7P"

Loved it. When the Echo Plus with Built in Hub was released in 2017 … Nice. The hub gave me the luxury of controlling my garage door after buying Nexx Garage. With these two Echo's - I also purchased the Amazon Voice Remote because the Echos did not have much range for ""listening"" around corners and from different rooms. The Voice Remote was essential, but solved the issue. I also added an Echo Dot in an obscure corner of the house for better Alexa coverage. When the Echo Plus with ZigBee (2nd Generation) was released in October 2018 … I stressed over whether I should take the plunge and add another. Would it be ""that"" much better? I DID buy it and I am soooooooo glad about my decision. PROS: #1 - Pairing accessories with this latest version is easy and intuitive. Everything works flawlessly. My previous two Echos had me ranting in frustration when trying to add a smart home device. And most ended up being returned out of failure to pair. #2 - The internal microphone is so finely tuned - I can call out commands from other rooms and even outside the house (when the windows are open) and Alexa responds perfectly. #3 - THE SPEAKERS. Oh the sound is phenomenol !! Yet - I was going to call Amazon support because there was a ""rattle"" sound frequently from the speakers/unit when playing music. I went next to the unit to record the ""rattle"" so I could play it for the tech rep when I called. It was them that I realized the speakers were so dynamic - they were rattling my fine glassware that was in close proximity to the Echo. Once the glassware was moved - the speakers are sensational and flawless. I play Spotify all the time now. It sounds wonderful on the new Echo !!! This 2nd Generation Echo is worth every penny and then some. I now have my entire house paired with receptacles, light bulbs, my garage door opener and a Phillips Color Hue bulb. Pairing and grouping everything was absolutely simple !!! There is never a glitch in operating the accessories. AND best of all - I know what I will be buying for family holiday gifts.","","If You Are Undecided .. Dont Be ...

I listen to pop and rock a great deal, nature sounds for sleeping, and right now some opera arias. I am happy with all of them. The new look is wonderful. I like that it is shorter and wider. More stable on a shelf or table. I do a great deal of house sitting and take many of my own things with me. This is getting packed in that travel bag!

Most of my home automation was handled by SmartThings. With the addition of the new Plus, I have retired SmartThings and am slowing trying to have Alexa handle all of my HA tasks. The major issue holding this back is that Alexa's support for sensors is brand new and not yet fully developed. For example, the new Plus has a temperature sensors built in to it. But there isn't - currently, I hope - support for simply asking Alexa what the temp is in the room where the Echo Plus resides. On top of which the features that are currently implements don't work so well. I created a routine that was supposed to send me a notification any time the temp in my living room got below 65 degrees. Just a simple routine to test how the temperature sensor is working. It worked sort of. I would get my notification but it would usually be delivered several hours after the trigger condition had been met. Otherwise, the new Echo Plus seems to work well. Discovering Hue light bulbs works seamlessly. The sound is much better than my 1st gen Echo, even to my ancient ears. It's smaller, better looking and so far, at least, does everything that it's supposed to do.

So we're in it for the long haul. We went to upgrade our final Echo Dot to a full-fledged Echo. This was our first 3rd Gen (our 2nd Gen Echos are wonderful, so we figured, the 3rd Gen must be even better). The sound quality and ease of setup was second-to-none (comparable to 2nd Gen - no marked improvement - probably given that the 2nd Gen is about perfect). HOWEVER, we stream a lot of music in our home. And Echo usually does a flawless job at it, even syncing across devices. However, one small (arguably nitpicky) problem with this 3rd Gen unit. When you wake this unit while music is playing, it pauses the music as expected to listen to your command; however, after pausing it also sounds a momentary crackle/pop (and by momentary, a teeny-tiny fraction of a second). You start talking to it and it pops. Just enough, however, to drive you mad. And frankly, it's just not acceptable. Not when our other units work perfectly. I contact tech support, and they said that they were able to replicate it, and that it was ""completely normal."" Well, I'm a reasonable person, but this just kind of cheapens the experience, and frankly I'm not convinced it is normal behavior (by the way, we restarted it/reset it/upgraded it/basically everything to try and rectify). And maybe this wouldn't be an issue for most (the speaker is wonderful otherwise), but we use our Echos heavily, often interrupting the music to turn on lights, for example, and I just don't want to hear it pop and crackle when I'm talking to it.","","It's an Echo...but crackles when woken...","11","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGUC65BVAFYAAPZJD2BEC5XTCKAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NFTVP7P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Amazon","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36R1UT87JFDUZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NFTVP7P","B07NFTVP7P"

The sub seems overpriced so I had hoped this would pair with the dot and give me the low end that I needed. I searched everywhere to see if an Echo and a dot would pair and could not find an answer! I had hoped that since both were the newest generation they would pair. NOPE! One workaround, you can play both simultaneously in the same room if you setup multiroom sound. However, the two will still not be stereo which pisses me off. AMAZON please fix this glitch. Why on earth can you not pair ANY two Echo products? Especially the same generation models?

I must say I was quite impressed with the sound after the dots. I also paired with an echo sub and a 4K Firetv Stick. With the Alexa app, the capability is there to set up a “theater” system. Actually it works pretty well. Setup took about 15 minutes including the speaker software/firmware updates. Sound..... So I’ve had for the last 20 years a 5.1 system with different high end receivers and Paradigm speakers. Now, I was NOT looking to duplicate the sound that system produced but, I was looking for something decent. Actually these 3rd gen’s paired with the little echo sub do pretty well. I’ve actually had quite a few people over that had in the past enjoyed my other system for “movie nights” or just sitting around playing cards listening to music, and they’ve all been impressed. Enough so that most are looking at setting up the same system at home. I’m not going down the road of specs and stats. I’m just going to say I’m impressed and would purchase all again. I’m hoping in the future there will be a firmware/software update that will integrate these speakers into a full surround. A 5.1 or even a 5.2 would be super. For now I’m extremely happy with them. For the price they’re great. If you’re an idiot looking for super audio file sound or Einstein knowledge for speakers then keep looking.

The onboard temperature sensor is routinely off my 10 or more degrees Fahrenheit. I have two other indoor digital temperature sensors by different manufacturers sitting right beside the Echo Plus, they are within 0.8 degrees of one another other, today showing 78 and 77.2 degrees Fahrenheit. Since one rounds to whole numbers the difference could be as little as 0.3 degrees between them. By comparison the Echo Plus says the indoor temperature is currently 67.2 degrees Fahrenheit. That's a difference of 10 to 11 degrees from the accurate/correct reading. Even without the two other digital temperature sensors you can feel the indoor temperature of the room is in the middle 70s not the middle 60s. Amazon customer service did offer to exchange the device but based on other reviews indicating regular inaccurate temperature readings I declined the offer since the problem seems to be due to a calibration issue with the sensor. There is no method available to manually recalibrate the sensor or manually offset/adjust it - other than to perform a factory reset of the device which I've done half a dozen times or so to no effect. On the plus side the sound quality is good and Alexa integration is on par. I have the Echo Plus in the same room (across the room) from an original Echo 1st Gen. Unfortunately the two devices frequently get confused as to which device you're closest to when addressing ""Alexa"". In fact sometimes both devices respond at once. That's not so good. Believe it or not, the Echo Plus 2nd Gen more frequently misinterprets or fails to properly understand verbal commands/questions when compared to the much older Echo 1st Gen. Also not good, but again the sound quality is a little better than the older Echo device. Sound quality of the Echo Plus 2nd Gen compared to any generation of the Echo Dot is far superior for both bass and treble. You can play back music simultaneously thru both Echo devices but only by playing back thru all Echo devices. Echo devices are only capable of ""stereo playback"" if they are the same models. Over the years I've purchased 1 Echo, 5 Echo Dots, 1 Echo Plus, 1 Echo Input, and I have yet another Echo Dot arriving in January 2021. I've given away 4 Echo Dots as gifts so January 2021 will be my first opportunity to test the Echo Dot's ""stereo playback"" ability. To sum up, if a primary reason you desire to purchase an Echo Plus 2nd Gen is for the temperature sensor capability or because you believe its responses will be more accurate than other Echo models, you might want to look elsewhere or spend less. Since I've purchased 9 Echo devices over the years I'm clearly a strong advocate for this Amazon device product line. At the same time I do my best to review these electronic devices fairly and accurately. My primary profession is in computer technology and electronics. My secondary profession is in ranching. My cattle, sheep, goats, and chicken flocks seem to appreciate the Echo serenades I give them sometimes.

For the past year or so, it quit responding to the wake word as quickly and seamlessly as it had in the past. This year, the maker of our smart hub decided to start charging a monthly fee so decided we needed a new hub. We figured it was time to upgrade the echo to the echo plus with the hub built in and take care of both issues. The good: The hub section works and communicates with our devices. The sound quality is good. The volume is really loud. My remote that came with the original echo device paired with this; thus, I can still use it. It has a built in thermometer and can tell me the temperature in the kitchen (where it is located). The bad: This device still has a difficult time hearing us and responding, just like the old one did. (Maybe it’s because I have echo dots in all the other rooms of the house, and an Echobee thermostat in the hall). I can only get the temperature of the kitchen when I asked the Echo plus that is in the kitchen, none of the other echo dots in the other rooms can access that information. The hub in the echo plus does not control all of my smart devices, so we ended up buying an additional hub anyway, which will control everything, including the items that this one will. (Before purchasing it for the hub feature check compatibility with your other devices). It randomly changes volume. One time i ask it a question and it will be super loud, and the next time the volume will be normal. I usually have to say, “Alexia,” 3 times in order for it to respond. It lights up when I say, “Alexia,” the first 2 times, but doesn’t actually answer the questions or set the timers until the third try. I am going to keep this device, but the additional cost wasn’t worth it for the extra features or the frustration I have in trying to get it to respond. Or maybe my Ecobee thermostat is just really far superior with the microphone listening in, because it is always responding when I am trying access my echo plus. I can be standing next to my echo plus and the thermostat in the hall way will respond. I did turn off the microphone on the thermostat, but the echo plus in the kitchen still didn’t respond all the time, so I turned the microphone back on on the thermostat, and if the timers are set in the hall I just have to deal with it.","","Same problem as my original, it can’t hear us, or allows a farther away device to respond instead.","","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGXXNB2FXMNKOLZYPDC2NS3K7G5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NFTVP7P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Amazon","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/REPKHSX8JA8RE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NFTVP7P","B07NFTVP7P"

That never occurred. 48 days after purchase, I finally decided that I had enough, and requested help from Amazon Customer Service. They wanted me to mess with my router and changed the channel to 1 or 16. They tried to blame it on everything except the device. After much back and forth, they agreed to send a replacement. The replaced was cosmetically unpleasant (damages - nicks and discoloration everywhere). I contacted customer service and told them this was unacceptable. They wanted to send out another refurbished product with the only guarantee that it will work (nothing about cosmetically sound). It's too late to get my money back now, but I will change the wake word to something I never use and just use it as a bluetooth speaker. As far as the sound quality goes, it is acceptable as Radio Quality sound. There is a severe lack of bass without the subwoofer and a second Echo Plus.

I have the tap, the dot, the standard Echo and an Echo smart speaker, and now the plus. This one is definitely a step up. The best sound and response of all the previous models. In a nut shell The dot is ok. Limited quality sound but small and unobtrusive. Nice for a bedside alarm, weather information and morning news while shaving. The tap is the portable and battery powered option that I use in the morning. I listen to a streaming cable news show. I listen to it while in the shower, (it is not waterproof but I have a shelf far from water that it sits on), then while I shave, and I put it in the closet while getting ready and dressed. It's like a portable radio but it allows me to stream internet cable and listen to anything I want. The standard Echo and Echo with smart options is a great device. The addition of the smart features is ok. It allows you to turn on lights and fixtures, but going into a dark room and saying, ""Alexa, turn on lights!"" is not as easy as flipping a switch. It is ok for lights that are not near the bed and your heading to sleep. But, you'll wake people up by shouting the wake up command. This one is good for two reasons: 1.) The sound is great. Better than the others. 2.) I got a smart switch and can use it to turn on any number of devices. The hook up was easy and flawless. Also, Alexa is adding new skills. If you use a sound machine, she has a sound maker for sleeping. Wake up to the weather, the stock market, the news, a fact from history, and a joke of the day. If you are on the cusp of buying this device, making this your first Echo would be a great choice. If you have an Echo or tap, this is a good upgrade.","","Better sound, great connectivity, looks better, and turns on the lights","33","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGFPQCUEVTD3AFRO4O3ZV3BQQE6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NFTVP7P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Amazon","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1UY2ZF48QFWYP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NFTVP7P","B07NFTVP7P"

Performance is quick, audio is great, and the built-in Zigbee hub works quite well. Longer Review; After dragging my heels for over a year, I finally bought our first Echo (2nd Generation) back in August. I loved it so much that I got us 2 more for other areas in the house. Being able to group them and play the same music or audio throughout the house is a novelty that won't grow old for me. I've only wished that they had a little more full sound, especially at higher volume. I'd considered the last Echo Plus, but the average of reviews I read didn't make it appear to perform significantly better than our already great 2nd Generation Echos. When I saw this new Echo Plus listed, I pre-ordered it to ""replace"" the Heather Grey Echo in our kitchen and move that one to our bedroom. We tend to have music playing in the kitchen more than any other room, and I wanted slightly better sound than the regular Echo in there. I'm honestly glad we took a chance on this device without any reviews to go by. Appearance; As you can see in the photos, it's pretty much identical in height to the 2nd Generation Echo. It is a bit wider to accommodate the larger speakers, and the top is slightly domed instead of being flat. A similar 7-microphone array is on top and they seem to work just as well. There also appears to be a tripod-style connector on the base of the unit. Setup; Setup was surprisingly easy as this Echo Plus detected our network settings on its own. I plugged it in, it did its initial startup, and then told me the device was connected. Simple as that. Audio compared to 2nd Generation Echo; Highs are clearer. Mids are more natural and better-defined. Lows are deeper. Overall volume is noticeably louder and sound quality is improved. When paired with our other Echos, music and audio is in sync everywhere and this device stands out above the others in audio performance. General Performance; We have a quick network and I don't notice any perceivable performance difference between this new Echo Plus and our regular 2nd Generation Echos. Everything seems to work as it should. I bought this with the ""free"" Philips Hue bulb promotion. This bulb is our first Zigbee device and works very well with the Echo Plus. It is easily controlled by either the Echo Plus or the other Echos we have in the house. I'll be keeping an eye out for deals on these bulbs in the future. Like our other Echos, it also has no problem controlling our Kasa Smart Plugs. Overall; While $150 is a lot for a single speaker, for what I was looking for, this thing excels. If you like the 2nd Generation Echo but hoped it sounded a bit better, I would highly recommend this. Based on what I've read, if you were disappointed with the audio performance with the 1st Generation Echo Plus but want everything else it had to offer, consider giving this wonderful speaker a try. P.S.: The internal ambient temperature sensor seems fairly accurate and nice to have included.","","Great Device with Impressive Audio","1,111","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGDSZMBAOZVBPDG3BNKMLA2I5XDA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NFTVP7P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Amazon","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R292EDCU0BOB0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NFTVP7P","B07NFTVP7P"

This was one of EIGHT Fire TV and/or Echo devices that I purchased on Black Friday, hoping to switch from Roku TV and have a seamless smarthome experience. Oh boy, was I wrong. Whether I rename the the Fire TV devices or use their original names, the echo devices CANNOT control or recognize the tv devices, even after properly pairing them under the TV & Video setting in the Alexa app. I've tried to unpair, repair, restart, unregister, reregister, you name it. I've wasted days. Generally, Alexa responds with 'I cannot find a device named ...' I consider myself very technically savy and I'm positive this is not something that I'm doing wrong. I should've read more into this before buying. TONS of people all over the internet are having this problem. It's infuriating. Plain and simple, until problems like this are fixed, Amazon is blaintantly false advertising the way that their devices work. Other cons to note: -Multiple video apps stutter and sometimes even randomly pause without ever resuming unless you physically resume them. -Alexa drastically lowers the volume of the TV when you are voicing a command. This in-and-of-itself is not a huge problem. However, it becomes a problem often when after the command is complete, Alexa does not resume the original volume of the content. When this has happened, I've had to ask Alexa to turn the volume back up to the specific number it was at. -I have two third generation echos paired as a stereo system for the TV. Often, even though I have my fire TV set as the preferred device, only the echos hear my voice, and once again, because they cannot control the TV, they say that they cannot recognize the device and then I just have to pick up the controller anyway. -The Fire TV will often think that it hears an 'Alexa' when absolutely no where near that word has been stated. Because the volume lowers drastically when Alexa is listening, it creates an obnoxious volume dip in content to listen for nothing when this happens. -You cannot set a sleep timer Honestly I could go on and on about the cons and about just how unhappy I am about these products. There are even more problems than what I listed here, but I'm not wasting too much breath, as after doing days and days of research on these topics, I've seen that Amazon has absolutely no answers to these problems, even after thousands of people have reported the same problems over and over. Unless there is some revalatory software updated coming, I'll be returning hundreds of dollars of equipment.","","Incredibly disappointed with Alex and Fire TV integration.

I saw the echo 3rd gen was new and on sale during Black Friday weekend for $60, so I grabbed one. We wanted another echo dot but after reading and watching reviews I decided to spend a bit more and go with a full blown echo. The echo dot 3rd gens are amazing. They really are. For $22 on sale they are especially a no brainer. The sound quality is night and day compared to the 1st and 2nd gen dot. Like twice as good regarding sound quality and fullness and how loud it can get. Alarms will actually wake you. After watching some reviews of the new big echo here, I was sold. Now and then we use the living room echo for some music while we clean or to just goof off and dance like idiots lol. While the dot did good, why not go fuller and louder with the big echo? Well, it’s still an amazing unit. Does all the dot does, of course. However, while the sound is fuller and louder, it’s not going to blow you away. I guess maybe I overhyped it based on the reviews I saw and their reactions, but I was a bit bummed. Yes, absolutely it’s louder...my totally unscientific measurement would be it’s like....15-20% louder and fuller sounding (deep, more bass, higher highs etc). I’m not sure what I was expecting. Maybe I’d be happier regarding sound with the “studio” version? I don’t know. I don’t regret the purchase, though. The extra volume is welcome and it definitely does sound better with music.

It was bittersweet for me to replace it with the newer 3rd Gen but they had an amazing trade-in offer so I had to take advantage of it. First thing to note this Echo is much shorter than Gen 1 but a little wider which I prefer because it looks and fits better on my kitchen island. The new blue color is amazing if you’re considering getting it! Setting up the new Echo was the easiest most seamless process! I literally took it out of the box, plugged it in and in under a minute it set itself up and was ready to use! I didn’t have to do anything, it was already programmed with my smart lights and my WiFi, couldn’t ask for an easier setup. I love my Echo and use it every day and if you’re considering getting one, I say go for it! If I had to critique or complain about anything the only thing I could say is the wall adapter is really large since it’s still a square block like Gen 1. This is more of a personal opinion but Gen 1 had a rotating top to turn the volume up and down (which I loved) where as Gen 3 has volume up and down buttons. Functionally they both work I just though the rotating volume top was more fun and unique, but I’ll live on just fine with the buttons.","","Bittersweet Upgrade","526","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHGVKCSPSWGPWLNSLR7C756WLBXQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NFTVP7P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Amazon","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VA1DU4ILBRDG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NFTVP7P","B07NFTVP7P"

Sound quality is really good. I love music, blasting it loud and it handles it really well. Even just as a music player I'd be happy. Not as good as my Bose but there is a huge difference in price and my Bose sits in one spot on one end of the house not playing everywhere like these. Really impressed with the sound though.

I tried to get some integration going with TP-Link switches so I can turn the lights on and off. Alexea indicates the lights are OFF when they are ON and vice versa. Easier to use the TP-Link app. Same for Honeywell thermostats. No benefit to using Alexa. The interior temperature sensor, that apparently took an hour to ""calibrate,"" is consistently off by 4-5 degrees. Alexea doesn't understand the words ""calibrate"" or ""recalibrate."" So, that's busted. Weather conditions are poor. No indication of dew point or even relative humidity. Cloud cover, etc. Just temperature. No weather warnings or alerts? Just experienced a hurricane, but it was news to Alexa... Volume is way off between various sources and there is no way to normalize. I am constantly either adjusting the volume manually or asking alexa to do so, and the increments she does it and the buttons are not the same. Can't get alexa to realize I've read my notifications and her yellow light keeps blinking. Equalizer is lame and doesn't seem to do much at all. Supposed to have my Comcast TV schedule available -- if it's there, I can't find it. The alexa app does not recognize or remember the volume settings and always reverts to minimum. Speaking of the app --- who was the brainaic who decided that tiny blue letters in an illegible font against a black background was good? It's terrible, and there is no way to adjust the font color, size, or background. The app wastes nearly all of the iPad real estate with bits and pieces along the edges and a huge black hole of nothingness in the middle. Handling ""privacy"" is a complicated matter...hard to find things and there are several different settings and places one has to look.

I even own 9 Amazon echos in my own home and vehicle. Prior to using this Amazon Echo 3rd generation I had Amazon Echo 2nd generation speakers in my living room set up as a theater system group. They worked great! Each Echo had a different wake up work so I can speak to that particular Amazon Echo. One Amazon Echo was set up as left speaker and one was set up as right speaker. I decided to upgrade my Amazon echos to the 3rd Generation Amazon Echo. After setting them up the same way I had my 2nd generation setup I can tell you that I am completely dissatisfied. although these speakers works great in a theater group when watching TV, use the wake up word Alexa to call my right Amazon Echo the light ring will respond but the echo with the Wake word Echo response verbally instead. If I remove the Amazon echos from the theater group The correct Echo will respond. I contacted technical support and they are completely clueless. I then decided to test out my whole house group that I use quite often to play my music in every room. Most of the time my speakers don't respond at all and they don't play music. if they do respond , only 1 Amazon Echo plays the music even though these Amazon echos are in the same group that I asked to play. When I tried to tell them to stop , they acknowledge me speaking to them but do not stop playing the music. It became extremely frustrating to the point where I was yelling at my echo With no response. Amazon really needs to go back to the drawing board on this 3rd generation and fix their bugs.","","Complete junk. Unresponsive.

She is getting better. One thing you should know if you own any Hub whether it is an Echo, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings, or whatever people will hear you even if you think the speaker is off. I just think you should know that. Personally, I feel since they can listen in on you with your cell phones what does it matter. You can always unplug, and turn off your internet. If you do research about this on the net try using .gov, .org. , or .edu websites. I learned in school these are more likely to be true. So, why get a Hub? I love it because it makes life a lot easier. If I want to know anything, I ask my Google hub ( she knows more info because she is better with web searching than Alexa). If I want to spell something I ask Alexa (she is a better speller). You can use any hub to ask about weather, how to cook something, games, read you a book, play music, news, turn on/off smart stuff like... plugs, lights, thermostats, TV, coffee makers, dryer/washers etc.... It can work smart cameras, smart beds. You can ask, is the back bedroom light on, They are coming out with new stuff for them to do all the time. I can't wait until they come out with a ""clean my house"" command. lol Also, you can call someone ( I often call my own phone because I lost it in the house lol ) ETC.... Please note, I do feel it is dangerous to let a smart device control locks, garage doors, cameras in your home, or anything else that might be a security threat. As you know there are a lot of hackers out there that are willing to take advantage of others. Even the cops are hacking ring door bells ( the Washington Post had written an article about it). I own two of the Echo Plus (2nd Gen), one Echo Dot (3rd Gen), 2 Google Homes, and 2 Google Minis. Ok - I admit I went a little over board . lol Things to know... 1. When you buy Alexa you can hook her up to your Amazon acct. I like doing that online when I am buying it. 2. However, once you get an Alexa, and plug it in at home, the Alexa will ask you about hooking up to your voice, to account. If you say yes, Alexa tries to sell you stuff a lot. Example: I asked for the price of Duct tape, and Alexa said, ""I put the Duct tape in your shopping cart"". So, I feel it's better just to hook it up online only, and not hook it up to your voice after you have it at your house. 3. Alexa can start off very buggy. However, if she is buggy after about 17, or 18 days Alexa works out many of her bugs. 4. If you get Alexa, I would recommend getting Prime membership. If you do have an Amazon Prime membership you will get a lot of songs. However, some you have to pay another yearly fee, on top of your Amazon Prime membership fee. Ouch! 5. For keeping cost down I feel that the Google is better. Google Home gives you a lot of free stuff like bedtime stories, music, ETC. Where Alexa you have to pay for just about everything. The more stuff you get the more it will add up. An example is Alexa bed time stories are $79.99 plus tax a year if you are a Prime member. If you are not, it will cost you $99.98 plus tax. Again Amazon-Ouch! However, if I had a lot of money, I think I would like Alexa a little bit better than Google. Tough call. If you want to read more about the Google, and Alexa because you don't know what you want than read below. Hope this helps... Compare Amazon Alexa hubs to Google hubs. Google is easier to use because it understands more words, and phrases. The Echo Plus sounds better than the Google Home. So, if you want great sound with Google Home, you might want to get a good speaker for it. The sound is really I'm All Bout That Bass, Bout That Bass (I mean it's all about the speaker quality). Sorry, I couldn't help myself. You will find that there are some songs Amazon doesn’t have at all no matter what you pay. They are normally the rare songs. One example is Night Beach by Dream Singer. While Google Home, works with every song out there that can be downloaded for free. Just pick a song you own from your iTunes, computer, or whatever song that you already paid for, and upload it yourself for free (easy to do, just YouTube it). After that you can create your own playlist. Google has a lot more choices when it comes to making up routines. Google also has quiz games that you can have more than one player. Google ask you how many people are playing each time . Alexa does have quiz games, but they are only for one player unless you add MultiPlayer Skill. Even with adding MultiPlayer you have to ask Alexa before starting the game. If you don't ask Alexa in the right way, she gets mixed up. Alexa has more brand name smart devices, but not more kinds of devices. Example: Alexa will work with an Foscam security camera, and Google will not. However, there are plenty of security cameras that work with both Google Home, and Alexa. So, they both work the same kind of stuff. The Echo Plus (it must be the plus that has the thermostat in it) can tell you room temp. The Google doesn't do the room temp. However, you can buy a smart thermostat for your home to hook up to the Google. They both will tell you the outside temp. Google tracks packages throw Gmail, so it can be ant package, but it is tricky to set a Google Home up to Gmail. Alexa tracks only Amazon packages. Alexa lets you know when you have a package at your door from Amazon by a lighted ring on top of the device. I feel Alexa can be nosey, and rude. One example: Once it asked me if I had a tattoo, and I said that's a personal question. Then it asked ""what kind of tattoo do you have?"" Then I said you shouldn't be asking questions like that. Then it said that it wanted a black bird tattoo. The point is that It assumed that I had a tattoo, and would not drop the subject. It will ask you a lot of questions if you let it, so it knows what stuff to try to sell you. I have learned to watch what I say, so there is not as much sales pressure. Also, I say ""Alexa Stop"" about two or three times in a row. That way it stops talking. The Home Google is very polite. Also, it doesn't try to sell stuff to you. I hope Home Google stays that way. Both Alexa, and Home Google have improved over time, and still are improving. They will keep trying to outdo each other. I do like having both of them. I hope this helps.","","Without saying the wake word the Echo will but into conversation when you are talking.","2","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHSRSAOJTHI4LCNRXIFQXS4MMV5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NFTVP7P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Amazon","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3P1LQQFWUFHGH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NFTVP7P","B07NFTVP7P"

But it has far too many bugs to be worth it anymore. It started just a few days after I received it. I had to do a factory reset because it got stuck on a notification that it couldn't play because it had disconnected from the internet, then it got stuck on a red ring immediately after. I had to delete everything I had worked to set up just a few days before in order to do the factory reset. It was working fine for a few weeks after that, then today it stopped playing my Spotify music, I had to relink my spotify premium account and reconnect the echo plus to the internet via set up mode, then it played spotify but could not access my playlists. When I asked ""Alexa, play my *name* playlist on spotify"" it would play a random playlist on spotify by the same name. Now is has unlinked from my spotify again, even though in the Alexa app it says I'm linked and good to go. I have given up. 30% of the time it will misunderstand me or not hear me at all, and I speak loud and clear in anticipation of it not hearing me correctly and it is in the center of the room so the microphones aren't blocked. I have overlooked most of these little bugs and brushed it off as this relatively new tech still finding its feet, but today's spotify fiasco was the last straw for me.

I bought some google home minis, but found you had to download apps from outsiders in order to use the smart light I wanted. I looked at the privileges that were being demanded by the app and decided an app to control lighting had no reason to know who I called, when I called, or anything else about me personally. Amazon already knows me (my husband thinks they pretty much own me) so I was more in favor of using the echo plus since it has a built-in hub and no third party app or skill was desired for the smart light I bought (actually, I received a free smart light bulb when I purchased the echo plus). I had a bit of trouble getting the light to work - Alexa didn't find it at first but I reset the bulb and then I was good to go. I agree with others that the Alexa app interface is not really intuitive, but now that I have the light up and running, I am in love. My 94-year old father is not very mobile and when he comes to stay with us, I wanted him to be able to turn the light on and off while he is still in bed. This feature now works like a champ so I am very happy. I have played some prime music and that works well, but I still have a lot to learn about all the echo's features. The only reason I would not give it 5 stars right now is the alexa app - but that is really a separate issue, so I gave it 5 stars.","","I don't know much yet, but what I have tried, I like very much!!","5","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFCFETDASD24UX4BSMD243PB2O6A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NFTVP7P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Amazon","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3L8ESUDHGZ7P7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NFTVP7P","B07NFTVP7P"

The sound quality is indeed excellent. The Alexa integration works just fine, and the voice quality & recognition are excellent. What's not to love? Well, the problem is poor WiFi performance. I give it 5 stars for voice, integration and sound. However, the WiFir performance - an absolutely critical element - is poor at best. One star for that. I have reset the device several times, moved it around the room, and done everything I can but it just has poor WiFi. The Echo Dot I replaced could stay connected and stream literally all day long without hitch in exactly the same spot with the same WiFi. This unit, on the same WiFi, the same day, could not stream for 5 minutes before skipping and losing connection on any of several tests. As a final test, I connected it to a WiFi unit in the same room. No problem - it works beautifully if it is literally in the same room as the 802.11 device. That's not practical. I am a huge fan of Alexa & the Echo's (sounds like an 80's band name) but this Echo hits a sour note.

It has the exact same dimensions, weight, speakers, and fabric cover as the 2018 Echo PLUS Gen 2 (with the added color option of Twilight Blue). Echo Gen 3 vs regular Echo Gen 2: -Gen 3 is slightly wider (3.9"" vs 3.4""), and slightly lighter (27.5oz vs 29oz), but about the same height -Gen 3 has bigger speakers: 3.0"" neodymium woofer and 0.8"" tweeter; (Gen 2 was 2.5"" woofer and 0.6"" tweeter) -Gen 3 has an auxiliary port on the back that can serve as an output OR input. (Gen 2 was output only) -Gen 3 can be stereo paired with another third-gen Echo or with the Echo Plus. UPGRADE OPINIONS: I can definitely tell the difference in the speakers, especially at higher volume levels. The 3rd Gen speakers produce a fuller sound, and more powerful bass. This wasn't as noticeable at lower volumes, but still an audio enthusiast would be able to tell. Don't expect to be utterly blown away though, the difference is not as great as the difference between the Echo and the Dot, for example. If you already have an Echo Gen 2, it is probably NOT worth replacing it with the Echo Gen 3 yet. It is just a slightly better speaker and the added audio input. Echo Studio is a much bigger upgrade for sound quality in my opinion. THINGS WE REGULARLY USE ECHO FOR: -Controlling thermostat, lights, fans, smart plugs, Roomba, etc. -Setting alarms and timers. Especially timers! -Asking for Weather, News or Sports updates -Calling friends/family -Playing music, sometimes in multiple rooms at once -Managing shopping lists -Asking any question that is faster to ask than type into my phone/pc -Playing games with paired Echo Buttons -Translating things from one language to another -Getting recipes and cooking tips -Listening to audiobooks","","New Echo, same speakers as Echo PLUS Gen2!","205","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGJNDB3P4G3BWHS23YMSCRBRFIFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NFTVP7P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Amazon","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R311WDT2GB5XT4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NFTVP7P","B07NFTVP7P"

The sound quality gets spotty (pun intended) as you increase the volume. Two Echo's and a sub are not a replacement for a high end sound system obviously. But the convenience is nice being about to group areas on the different speakers/zones and have music everywhere in the house. I do wish a equalizer was available in the Alexa app for each speaker. I know the ability is there to achieve this with the technology that is in the Echo plus but Amazon has apparently decided not to provide that capability. Since I have a home office my attempts to mesh Alexa and Cortana (Windows 10) have been a bit frustrating.

(It's a shame, I know, but this is hopefully just until they get the kinks worked out.) Get a Dot. Mute mic on both Echo Pluses. Delete the stereo pairing in the Alexa app. Change Line In/Out jacks to In in the settings for each. Use a left/right breakout cable going from the Dot mini stereo jack to one cable for each Echo Plus. The remote works with the Dot at all times as it should.

BUT, I do feel deceived by amazon on this. The Echo Plus does have a ""smart hub"" that uses Zigbee to connect to various smart home devices. HOWEVER, the Echo Plus can only utilize the PHILLIPS HUE system in a limited capacity. In order to get full use out of the HUE bulbs, you still have to buy the HUE BRIDGE. What you can do with the Echo Plus alone: 1. Voice Control the lights. 2. Change the color of the lights by voice, BUT you are limited to about 20 colors instead of the ""16 million colors"" that the HUE bulbs are capable of. 3. You can set routines and groups, which is nice. What you CANT do without the HUE Bridge: 1. Compatibility with many more sensors 2. The ability to automate and set scenes 3. get system updates over the air and future features. 4. Have your lights sync with music 5. Probably more, but I can't remember. Also, if you change devices, or switch to a HUE hub, odds are you will have to redo all of your lights. What bothers me more than anything is that the product page for the Echo Plus CLEARLY states compatibility with the HUE system, and even use the HUE APP logo as shown in the picture. That's great, except that you MUST have a HUE BRIDGE to use the app, which is another $50-60 on top of the already expensive investment of the bulbs. Craig I would like to see Amazon clarify that the HUE BRIDGE is necessary for the full HUE system, but I doubt it will happen. Alternatively, I would to see them bundle the Echo Plus and HUE together so that you can get the full system right out of the box. Hope this helps, Craig M","","BUYER BEWARE if you plan to buy this for the PHILLIPS HUE SYSTEM.","4,770","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHHNN3FQ6XPWBUDC5EVIMK5ZESXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NFTVP7P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Amazon","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BGI88540OBN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NFTVP7P","B07NFTVP7P"

I have a Bose, which always outperformed other small sound systems for me, but the Echo 2nd Gen--although individually not quite as good soundwise as Bose--sounds just as good when the two speakers are paired, and along with the subwoofer slightly outperform the Bose. The trebles are clear and the bass isn't overwhelming, but it's a good solid sound and feel. There's a good balance between treble and bass and you can ask Alexa to decrease or increase both. The volume level can also get extremely loud, which I found has been lacking in most speakers this size. The setup can be a little glitchy with the Alexa app, which seems buggy and is not that user friendly when it comes to setting up and pairing, but even I, who is no tech wiz, was able to figure it out and finally pair everything up. I've tried so many small speakers like this and have always been disappointed, so I'm glad I finally found some that live up to my expectations. Super happy I bought these.

Over and over I say ""Echo turn WRITING table lamp on"" and get back that it can't turn ""CONSOLE table lamp on."" Those things do NOT even sound alike. And it NEVER just does its job and SHUTS UP, even with the minimal talking setting turned on. This is like being in a torture chamber where the longer it goes on making the same mistakes and talking incessantly my first reaction is to see red and scream at it. I've seriously got to look at other options. This is beyond belief bad, and needlessly so. Don't believe me? Google Echo ""a few things share the name"" and see how many people are having this issue -- for years now, unfixed. Worse? There's nothing more unnerving than hearing a prowler outside your house and telling Echo to turn on downstairs lamps and having it argue with you while your house and garden is still in the dark with someone outside. You will literally want to bash this piece of garbage into the cement just to get some satisfaction and closure. ______________________________ This more expensive speaker was billed as working via Zigbee even when your Internet connection is down. It's never worked reliably even for turning a light off and on. The older Echo Dots were actually more reliable than this ever was. At any rate, I have just about reached my limit with Amazon and Echo and am looking for a competitor's product. Like eBay that used to work quickly and simply, over the years it's been bloated to the point it's time consuming and labyrinthine. I assume this is because workers and supervisors need to show results and justify their existence so over time what worked simply becomes bloat ware. As a reult of this, now when ask what time it is instead of just answering briefly it tells me the time AND then tells me to have a nice day, or to enjoy national blah blah blah day. Think about what just happened there. A MACHINE with no real personality just took the time (and my time) to wish me a nice day. Maybe that's cute once, but it gets annoying. Imagine if you flipped a light switch in your home and instead of just doing its job it suddenly had a personality and wished you a good day, and then your toaster, and so on, all throughout the day. It's ridiculous. That's not what I bought into. I literally simply wanted to be able to walk into a room and turn on three lights at once instead of having to go around the room and do it one by one. Not even that works anymore. The system works for awhile and then a name stops working, so if you've called it desk lamp suddenly you have to call it something else. There are only so many logical things to call it. So I've gone through a few name changes and each successive one and more and more strained to have some meaning. My living room is now ""Garden Room"" and so on. Worse still is the system repeatedly tells me a device isn't working and then I ask again just a second later and suddenly it works normally. Hey, Amazon, how about the stupid device tries three times before telling me it doesn't work instead of just the one? Just as infuriating is very clearly saying to turn something on and getting a message that says, ""A few things share the name 'table lamp.' Which one did you want? Well I've got WRITING TABLE lamp and STUDY LAMP and CONSOLE TALBE LAMPS and FRENCH LAMP and BEDROOM 1 LAMPS and BEDROOM 2 LAMPS and so on. Most of those things don't sound anything like one another, but still the device can't figure it out and constantly asks me which one I want. I suspect this has to do with waking up after you say the wake word so while it's doing that it misses the first (and more descriptive and unique) word and just starts listening at ""lamp."" Either way, it's annoying, and I don't recall this ever being an issue with the early/simpler/cheaper Echo Dots before I got this one. Every day is infurating, and because unlike a human it's the exact same thing, it's more maddening. I simply want to be able to say what time is it or what's the temperature or so on and get an answer, not a verbose response. Even if you want to play an audiobook and shoot the sound over from your phone to this speaker via Bluetooth that works, but Amazon in its infinite wisdom decided the speaker should (instead of just start playing your book) say, ""Now connected to blah, blah, blah."" Just play the book and we will know we're connected. Do a Net search for Amazon Echo or Amazon Alexa and the word verbose and you will see I'm not alone in my issues here. It's so awful even though I'm invested in this maddening system I'm looking into competing products designed by humans who actually gave them some thought as to how they interact with humans. The devices should be adapted to US, no US to THEM.","","Looking for a Replacement Brand","2","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGDNPXZHZBXDJ7ELU54GBGOYHP6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NFTVP7P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Amazon","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R18YKF4DRLDK2T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NFTVP7P","B07NFTVP7P"

It has great sound over the Dot version hands down - good base and highs. It takes a bit of investment of your time to learn all the nuances of what Alexa can do for you. With the app, you can set up your Echo to be an alarm clock, timer, grocery list, teach it a routine for each day (like giving the weather forecast, the latest news from a specific news source, turn on/turn off lights, thermostat control, play specific music (classical, rock, pop) etc.). But beware, the instructions for all this are not included with your Echo. You have to dig around (through e-books, YouTube, etc.) to become familiar with the commands and required outcomes. For example, my unit began to display a pulsating yellow light that became annoying at night in my bedroom. I couldn’t turn it off except by disconnecting the power. Of course, this could’ve become a deal breaker if I had to disconnect every nite (I kept all the shipping package just in case I needed to return it). Well, it turned out that this was one way the Echo communicates with you. It was trying to tell me It had a notification for me to listen to. Until I asked, “Alexa, do I have any notification?” the yellow pulsating light would’ve continued. Immediately after delivering all notifications, the yellow pulsating light stopped. By the way, the notifications were about shipping/delivery of packages coming from, wait for it...Amazon. Of course, other types of notifications are possible pending how you program your Echo. Like I said, this simple issue would’ve been a deal breaker for me if I hadn’t decided to invest some of my time in trying to resolve this simple problem. It wasn’t until I learned how to communicate with my Echo that the problem wouldn’t go away. But again, the answer was not included with this product. My feedback to Amazon would be to include a list of commands and a trouble shooting section for the buyer.

I also have the original Echo Dot, the next generation Dot, and now the Echo Smart Speaker. The reason I bought the new Echo is because we have Prime, and I feel like I'm cheating myself by not using Amazon Music. I am a diehard classical music lover, and there are a lot of CD's on Amazon that are at least partially included with Prime. My comments will mostly be about how SiriusXM and Amazon Music compare to each other, because Yamaha's WX-030 (now discontinued) sounds pretty much the same as the Echo. The Yamaha speaker has to be controlled with a tablet or phone, but really only if you're changing channels. There are buttons on top to control power and volume, and the unit holds the most recent channel in memory. SiriusXM streams directly to the speaker over wi-fi, and I've had very good experiences with it, sometimes streaming music all day long with no issues. You can integrate the speaker with an Echo, but I'm one of those people who thinks voice control is overrated. The only other downside to the Yamaha is that it doesn't have a line-in jack, unlike the Echo. My experiences streaming Amazon Music have been disappointing, to say the least. The speaker frequently stops playing. The other day it stopped and I asked Alexa to play something else, and she apologized and said the stream stopped due to inactivity. The music had only been playing a little over an hour. Today I asked her to play a show on SiriusXM called Baroque and Beyond, and she did so right away. But about a third of the way into the show, it inexplicably started over from the beginning. The stations on Amazon Music also have issues with volume level, which can be entirely different from one track to the next. I've also found the selections to be less than great. Amazon continually tries to persuade me to upgrade to Music Unlimited, but based on my experience with the music included with Prime, I would be very reluctant to pay more. Hopefully the service will improve over time, but after having the Echo for only about a week, I already find myself using it less and less.","","Not a perfect world","","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFGDHLJPJUNN2ZBHHLYKFO4B4HUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NFTVP7P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Amazon","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ONEMBE1FRYAW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NFTVP7P","B07NFTVP7P"

I have an echo dot 3rd gen and the sound quality was just not doing it for me. Is the sound quality better than the echo dot? Yes, the echo dot is mildly better than listening to music on your phone's speaker. Is the sound quality good? Not really. The bass is big . . . BIG. It tends to overpower the rest of the music. If you're looking for cymbals to have a crisp satisfying sizzle, the 3rd gen Echo is just not going to do it. As more layers and instruments build in a song, the sound gets muddy and the bass takes over. For direct comparison I used a $50 bluetooth speaker that has been my go-to for affordable and portable music around the house. Now this does not have audiophile quality sound, but it is passable and is able to give music some separation in order for it to be enjoyable. It blows the Echo out of the water. I've tried several locations in my kitchen in case acoustics were throwing things off, but to no avail. Does the Echo have bad sound? No I wouldn't go that far. Frankly, I just expected more out of a $100 speaker. If music is your thing, you're better off going for a purpose-built speaker or an Alexa enabled speaker that puts sound quality first. It is still evident that the primary function of the Echo is to be an Alexa hub and not a speaker. For reference, I used songs I know well with lots of layers. Foo Fighters are a go-to and Madness by Muse for building and adding layers. Unfortunately the 3rd gen Echo dulled these songs and just made them feel numb. If you're looking to get the best out of the Echo, you'll have to play with the audio settings. For me, I have the treble at +3 and the mid range at +2. The bass is plenty as-is. Bottom line/TLDR: If you want an Alexa hub first and foremost, get an Echo Dot - better value. If you want a speaker first with the added bonus of Alexa, spend the extra money and get one purpose-built to play music. The Echo suffers from middle child syndrome and does all things OK, but there are better options out there depending on what your priorities are.","","Disappointing Sound Quality - Echo Dot better value","","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHLJNLCSKCQR6HYFJVHMUX7YDESA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NFTVP7P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Amazon","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IN9STVBJBWZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NFTVP7P","B07NFTVP7P"

Wink Hub 2 started to have lots of problems and then have switch to a paid monthly fee service. So dumped Wink and bought the Echo Plus hub. Went through the reset procedure on all bulbs and linked them to the new Echo Plus hub. Was able to reset and link two bulbs in ceiling fixtures at the same time. To unlink the Cree bulbs from the old Wink 2 hub need to reset the bulbs. Reset procedure is to switch bulb off wait 2 seconds then on 2 seconds (or so, sometimes took longer) until when switching on the bulb blinks. They say 4 cycles but some bulbs took many more cycles before it blinked. Once it blinks wait a little bit and then turn off, then have the Echo Plus discover new devices and when it says to turn on new device switch the bulb back on. Bulb will dim a couple of times when Echo Plus finds it. Nice thing is the Echo Plus doesn't need a smart phone to find or control linking. Just use the Amazon Alexa app on a PC and create groups and assign bulbs to a group with a name that makes sense, bulbs can be assigned to many groups or even be a single bulb as a group. The Alexa app calls each bulb as first bulb, second bulb and so on... creating groups using whatever name you decide makes remembering what a light is called easier. And response time is much quicker, seems like instant so far. Much better then the Wink 2 hub. Just added two Innr Zigbee Smart Plug and linking was very easy. There is an app for smart phones from the Amazon store but my smart phone is too old to install that app. Supposedly that app will give greater functionality to the Echo Plus hubs. With the Wink hub was able to set up scenes that set groups of lights to desired brightness with a single command ""turn on movie"" with Echo Plus now say ""turn on movie 10%"". I created a group that includes whatever lights I want on for watching TV. If other lights are also on I just say ""turn lights off"" then say ""turn on movie 10%"". But then again with the Wink hub couldn't say ""turn off movie"" because it was a scene that turned lights to set levels so couldn't use same command to turn the scene off. With Echo Plus hub can say ""turn off movie"" and those lights turn off. Sound wise... I really didn't buy it for sound quality but it does sound much better then my Dot playing through a small portable battery powered Bluetooth speaker. But I was impressed about how much clearer music sounded from it.

A pair of them would make for a much better overall music experience, as a single mono device just isn't ideal when it comes to enjoying music... So, when the Echo Plus (2nd gen) arrived offering a built in stereo pairing feature/utility via the Alexa app, I immediately jumped onto getting a set of them and traded in my original Echo. The first let down was the sound. The original Echo simply sounded a bit better. It could go louder, and the sound was just clearer/cleaner. Perhaps it is the quality of the materials used in the original Echo, which just seemed more like a premium device as to fit/finish and the richer sound. Fine I thought - but certainly having a pair of the newer units would make up for a better overall Echo experience? Well, no, not really. Sound wise, even paired, I feel the original Echo just sounded cleaner/clearer. The bass was less muddy and the dynamic range was also a bit better, especially at higher volume levels. Now I'm not talking about a night and day differences here, but still, I fully expected the Echo Plus to have evolved somewhat in the sound department... and that simply isn't the case here. So all in all, if you are looking to upgrade for improved sound, well, there isn't really any reason to jump ship. Stick with your original Echo or explore the Sonus One speaker that has Echo support if you really want to upgrade your sound for music playback. Now, my biggest gripe about the paired Amazon Echo Plus is the fact that it is ONLY paired for music playback. Other than that, it acts as TWO completely separate devices. This is especially frustrating in a kitchen environment where you use timers and alarms all the time. Example: Ask Alexa to set a 15 minute timer. It does, choosing whichever Echo unit heard you I guess. Now walk around the kitchen and then call out, ""Alex, how much time left on my timer?""... And low and behold, the other unit hears you and responds telling you that you have no timers set! WHAT? With a stereo pair, you have to remember which device took your timer request and ensure that you are only speaking to it in order to get any info out of it? Really? How hard would it be to just have them act together in unison as one unit!? Why not provide that as an option? A paired set should behave and act as a single Alexa device! They should respond in unison to commands - which they do not! They should also know about each other timers/commands, but unfortunately they do not. Right now, stereo pairing is NOT what I expected. It only plays music in stereo paired setting, nothing else. Rather than getting a nice volume boost when responding to commands, you get just a single speaker. This is a tremendous let-down for having purchased two premium devices and wanting to use them together. If Amazon would fix this MAJOR issue, I'd easily raise my review to 4 stars. My original Echo was easily a 5 star device. The newer Echo Plus (2nd Gen) is only a 3 star device if you buy 2 of them and use them as a stereo pair. Purchased alone, I'd raise it to a 4 stars. (-1 for the poorer sound quality compared with the original Echo).","","Great, but with some issues","11","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGUGAUMB73NEIPGYKB5RYNGOM5DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NFTVP7P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Amazon","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35ZBKX0ORR6WX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NFTVP7P","B07NFTVP7P"

I know my phone has Siri and things that I could use and, while that is handy, it is not nearly as handy as Alexa. Alexa’s voice recognition is excellent and the device recognizes quick speech, multiple commands for one task, and understands and completes tasks for my little ones. I love that it works with Apple Music, which is one reason I don’t use other similar smart speakers. While I use Alexa to set timers, tell me recent news, play music, or check the weather most often, I continue to find things that can be done using this device. I love all the little “Easter eggs” that can be used. I also love the jokes and games that can be played. I very much enjoy playing the Harry Potter quiz. While I am at work, I can send messages to Alexa to speak out to my kids. I haven’t had Alexa very long, but I am constantly learning something new that this can do. The capabilities of this device are astonishing. This is super easy to use and surpasses my expectations. The only thing to note is that the speaker is a good one and can easily fill a room, but this speaker isn’t meant to really “jam.” If I turn the volume up to max (as I did one day just to see how loud it could get), it gets unclear and distorted. I have found that 85% is a really good area if you are wanting louder volume as it is easily loud enough for the room to be filled with sound and keeps everything clear. I highly recommend this device.","","An excellent addition to our home","","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHPPU4M3N2FIOENT7SXDUJPDS6PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NFTVP7P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Amazon","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJTNTH9UT6CRR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NFTVP7P","B07NFTVP7P"

One thing I do like about it is being able to switch off the power to it (unplugging it) so that it's not using WiFi bandwidth unnecessarily (like at night). It reconnects to WiFi the next time we power it up without any resetting. Alexa tells us when we have a package delivered. ""Alexa-what are my notifications?"" I love the ""dictionary"" feature. ""Alexa-spell concede"" (hint, it's not conceed). The sound is very good. But, it's only as good as the digital content it is receiving and playing. I have heard a couple of songs where the sound or song might have been just a little off but I expect that may happen on a Gen 2, Gen 4 or ""Studio"" device. I don't believe it's our actual device. We keep it in the kitchen on the wooden table so the bass really ""pops"". The ""360"" sound is fine I guess. I have not heard the 4th Gen or Studio play. Ours still seems ""directional"" but I guess that is because no matter where we are in the kitchen the sound is the same, hence, 360. Overall, we really like it. Maybe one day we'll sign up for ""Unlimited Music"" but not now. I would recommend this product, if you can find a new one. We bought ours at Lowes on sale. It would be nice if Amazon had a location or some way one could go to a place in person and ""try out"" the different devices. After all, they are ""Audio"" devices and having the different models on hand to ""hear & test"" is important. I read a lot of reviews of others ""testing"" and decided that we'd go with a 3rd Gen and not the 4th. But nothing beats standing right there and listening. I remember the days in Los Angeles where you could go into a record shop and ""spin"" or play a ""45"" before you bought it to see if you liked the A AND B side. What do you say Mr. Bezos, you've got the funding for that. Can you make that possible? I really don't like the ""buy & return"" mode of testing. Is that good for the ""carbon footprint""?

I installed one in the den and one in the master bedroom. I also installed 4 Alexa compatible security devices in those two rooms. The Echo were set up for Apple I-Tunes. After a week, the Echo in the bedroom worked flawlessly. The Echo in the den would constantly tell me that “Apple Music is not supported by this device.” The next time I tried the same command, the Echo would work. I never got this message on the Echo in the bedroom. I uninstalled and installed Apple Music Twice. It worked flawlessly for a couple of days, and then it went berserk again on the Echo in the den. As an engineer, I decided that I would run a totally controlled experiment with the response of the Echo as the only variable. I recorded several voice bytes with the exact same Alexa command of “Alexa Using Apple Music Play Willie Nelson Seven Spanish Angels.” All of the recordings had 10 seconds of silence at the beginning before it gave the “Alexa” command. I chose a specific sound byte that had properly worked twice in a row. I placed the recorder on the arm of the recliner that I usually sit. I had access to a sound meter calibrated and certified for regulatory noise compliance regulations on all governmental levels. The noise meter was last calibrated in November 2019. The certification is valid for 12 months. I placed the microphone of the noise meter within 2 inches of the Echo. I played the same sound byte 20 times without changing either the location or volume level of the recorder. The plots of what was received on the sound meter could be plotted, and all 20 plots were a perfect overlay. With scientific certainty, the Echo was receiving the exact same sound byte 20 times in a row without the slightest variation in sound level or voice intonation. The results: 8 times the Echo told me that Apple Music was not supported by this device, 6 times the Echo interrupted the sound byte and started playing unsolicited music and 6 times the Echo played the requested song via the requested source. Again, I could verify and certify that the Echo was receiving the precise same sound byte every time. I then took the recorder into the bedroom and played the sound byte 20 times there. The distance was about 3 times further away than in the den. The results, the Echo played the correct song 20 times in a row. There is obviously an issue with the quality control with this device. I got a good one, and I got a turkey.

The Alexa App is instrumental in the set up, so were my headaches caused by the app or the device? After logging into the wifi system and thinking i completed all that was necessary, i was left with a message in the device area. It said echo plus not available and needs to be removed. I tried a few things, unplug, plug, hold down reset. While i could ask and get response that indicated connection to internet, the device on the app, had no other means of editing or setting up. I called support and got a very helpful agent. Together we explored aspects of the Echo interface to no avail. Finally something happened i now had a new message on app “device is recalibrating and could take awhile”! I asked the agent if this was unusual, and was told “very uncommon”, and she would call me back in a couple of hours. Things i learned, in lower right corner, icon looks like house with vertical bars. This was the access to device setting. Once my recal competed, when using the menu on left, selecting device i was greated with my room temp! Look in upper right on this screen find 3 dots. Touch those then menu for this device opens. I created a group for origional echo and new echo plus naming it “everywhere”! So now i can say “alexa play _____ music everywhere” and both units play. Now i need to find out how to change phone number (cell right now) to a different number, to utilize phone call out. I did use it to try it out and that worked fine. Now i still have question on the aux in? Can i use IPod to play my own music. As a prime member i can play what is on Amazon Music, by asking. Oh the agent did call back as promised, so i asked her about the aux in use, the response was try it. I havent. So what could make this better? Maybe a PDF style manual explaining the app interface and what icons are, and what each will do ( like the house i mentioned earlier) vs guessing. Sounds great but came close to returning that is why i gave 3 stars. Created new review on 2nd generation echo plus.

I have used it to remind me of important meetings, check the weather, and of course, check the progress of ordered Amazon items. I also have 4 Echo Dots and an Echo show in the the house and it's been very nice to be able to link them and play music all over the house while I am cleaning or check in on the grandkids playing upstairs and call them down for dinner. It is also linked to our Ring doorbell which is very helpful because we have the system but no extra chimes so it alerts us through our iPads and phones which sometimes are set on mute and so fail to alert us of someone at the door. The Echos are much better for that, and that skill was easy to enable. We bought one for our mountain cabin, and I even talked to my husband there from home without a phone, because the Dot there is connected to our account. We can also listen for any activity there. My Echo Dot in the patio room helped me when I was accidentally locked out of the house without my phone. Luckily the patio window was open so I just called through it to Alexa to call my husband to come back to the house to let me in. I keep thinking this would have so helped to have when my father-in-law was alive. We tried to get him to wear a life alert after a few dangerous falls, but could never convince him. We could have set him up on internet (which he would never want on his own) linked a few dots and if he fell, if he could still speak, he could call us, OR we could check in on him and if he didn't respond, we could call for help. I mention this in case someone reads this who has an elderly relative who is resistant to using those other systems. Overall, I love the Echo Devices and find I am discovering more and more helpful functions they perform.","","Love the Echo, Dot, and Show!","","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGX4HR25I5HOGTZZAK2XIF43N2CA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NFTVP7P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Amazon","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2AN7OGSJPBUFK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NFTVP7P","B07NFTVP7P"

Later did more research on the subject and found out that lots of other people had the same issue with alexa not being able to control their equipment based on temperature. Another thing I noticed from Echo Plus 2nd gen was that there was a 10 second delay before playing ""tunein"" radio, with echo dot 2, that delay was only 2 seconds. And yet another annoying thing i noticed about Echo Plus 2nd gen is: while she's not playing anything if you ask her ""set volume to (a number from 1 to 10)"" she does not play confirmation sound tone so you can't know how loud she really is, on ""Echo Dot 2nd gen"" she plays that tone which is really helpful (even though confirmation sound after each normal request is disabled in settings). So for over a $100 buying a glorified mono speaker, no matter how amazing it sounds, just doesn't make sense in my opinion. P.S.

I have 5 echos, one in each room including the garage, I love them. I got this for the better sound to replace an echo 2 which I moved to a different room. With that said, this echo 3 is awful. 1.It seems like the microphones don't work well, often we have to say ""alexa"" multiple times, or when we speak another echo in a different room of the house will answer. We never had this problem with the echo 2 in that same location. 2.This echo constantly freezes, I have had to unplug it quite a few times because it got ""stuck"" trying to listen or process a command, never had this issue with our other echos On the plus side when it works, the speakers are significantly better than the echo2. But the headache of interacting with it far outweighs its benefits.

Then during Quarantine this year I read an Amazon article about hue wireless bulbs and I thought ""how cool is that"". So about $700 and 8 bulbs, one lamp, a bridge, and a full size echo later, I had what I thought was the beginning of a cool home automation system. Instead I was in line for one of the worst experiences of my life and something that cost me over $1,000 before I realized what a total waste of time and money it was, not to mention the added aggrevation that I'm overall trying to eliminate from my life, not add. First, upon receipt I created all these routines to let me easily turn on various lights at various colors or hues with a simple voice command. I though it was wonderful! Then, over time, Alexa stopped understanding me, so I would have to repeat myself a few times just to turn on the damn lights. It got to the point where I was thinking how nice it would be to simply use a light switch; not to mention losing my temper at a friggin box of bolts! Then today the Alexa app disconnected from all my devices for absolutely no reason at all. After not being able to resolve this problem, I called Amazon and this wonderfully helpful person in India who could barely speak English told me that I would have to delete all my routines and re program them from scratch. So I did that and an hour later, everything worked. Right up until I wanted to go to bed, when none of the lights in my house would shut off, and I discovered that once again all my devices had disconnected from the Alexa app for no reason at all. So this time I did what I should have done months ago. I disconnected and threw away all the wireless bulbs I had purchased, along with all my Amazon Echo devices, save one that I will keep in the kitchen to help with cooking timers. Otherwise, don't waste your money on Amazon devices because Amazon Alexa is total crap. Doesn't work. Never will. And by the way - did you know that these Amazon devices record snippets of what you are saying every few minutes whether you want that or not? Everything you have said either to an echo or not to an echo is recorded and available for you to see in the Amazon app. The purpose of Amazons echo devices are not to help you do anything, they are a way for Amazon to violate your privacy by getting a microphone in front of you 24x7.

So that might call for some music, as well as a referee (""who sings that song?"" ""what year did that movie come out?"") and who better than Alexa to answer all your trivia questions and settle all your arguments? Problem was that while I have 2 Echo Dots (one upstairs, one downstairs), they need to be plugged into an outlet, and that is not an option outside (for various reasons, even though there IS an outlet outside). So I needed an Echo Dot that was portable/rechargeable, and this is it!! It doesn't COME with the charging base (had to buy that separately), but it seemed like the only one that COULD be made portable. Of course it is much taller than the Echo Dot I had (which was like the first one ever made, and I won one from a contest at my job. I loved it so much that the next day I went out and bought one, to put upstairs). The sound is much fuller/richer, the bass tones. It was super easy to set up. Basically I screwed it into the charging base (that will be a separate review), plugged that into the outlet, it turned itself on and paired itself to my WiFi, and boom! done. It took a few hours to fully charge but was working right away. So, although I have not yet taken it outside to this patio, I'm sure I will.

I did this when I visited him, 1500 miles away. It worked flawlessly, the sound and bass is awesome, and then it failed the day before I was flying home. He would ask it to play music by some artist, and it would say it was going to play that artist, and then silence. Nothing. I power-cycled it and it started working fine. Then, simply power-cycling it didn't work. Although the light ring indicated that it recognized the wake word, it wouldn't even tell me the time. Again, the refurb Dot worked. A few hours before leaving him to prepare for my flight, I unplugged it and plugged in the Dot; redundancy. After about an hour, I unplugged the Dot and plugged the new Echo in. Worked great! However, I was not confident that it would work for the 3 months I'm away, and didn't have the time to get on the phone with support for a replacement. Well, it failed again, and I really can't do anything about it other than buy him another. You see, I've been on the phone with support for another failed Echo, and I doubt that I could get a replacement authorization without being physically present, hence the low score for support. And after mid-January, I won't be able to have it replaced. Don't get me wrong, I love the Echo in general. I have an Echo, Echo Plus, Echo Connect and three Echo Dots. Statistically, I've had good luck with the Echo products, which is why I purchased a new one for my Dad. Maybe I'll call support and see if I can get a replacement now, 1500 miles away and unable to touch it. If I can get a replacement, I'll give it 5 stars, since when it works, the sound is incredible (well, in a nursing home room).","","Started failing after about a month, and I didn't have time to call support.","8","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH5UCGWKPNYFAKWKBDD2RBV5JM4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NFTVP7P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Amazon","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15IX4M237MQNA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NFTVP7P","B07NFTVP7P"

Connect and automate virtually everything in your house as well as various communications alternatives and other services and functions, and be able to control it all through voice (by talking to it). The main problem, however, is that it's unreliable. For this reason I give it 2 stars. The promise of Alexa is like a dial tone (remember that?) or your Internet service. It becomes an essential part of your daily life, and you expect it to WORK 99+% of the time. If it doesn't, it seriously damages the fundamental value proposition and causes frustration, inconvenience, or worse. There are MANY companies who make ""Alexa compatible"" devices such as Wemo, Phillips Hue, etc. including Amazon itself, and as I'm sure you've noticed, many items sold on Amazon say ""Alexa compatible"". The problem is that on a pretty much random basis, items will lose their connection to Alexa and won't work through Alexa although the item itself still operates, and/or can be controlled by it's own app (such as a Wemo or Hue device). From everything I can tell, it has nothing to do with the Wifi connection since I've tested for strong signal strength and hi bandwidth, and there is no discernible pattern. A device will simply stop operating, and you get an error message in the app that the device is ""unresponsive"", or some other message. Also, sometimes the Echo will just not recognize what you are asking. I have an Echo plus, and two Dots. For some of my switches and lights, one Echo will recognize what I am saying, but another may not. Yet they are all connected to the same account and this happens relatively randomly for a given device, again there is no pattern. So, it's just REALLY frustrating that on a fairly random basis, Alexa will just not work for a particular device at a particular time. I have to re-set, re-discover, re-connect, or re-install that third party device. BTW, this ALSO happens with Amazon-made devices, such as the smart outlets. Also, there are different degrees of ""compatible with Alexa"". Some third party devices work completely fine through Alexa, but others have only partial functionality compared to using their own app. This is a problem since the promise of Alexa is a single point of control, but if you don't get to fully use the features of the particular device, you may have to occasionally resort back to using the third party app for certain features and functions. Check the ratings of your third party app integration. For instance, Ring makes very popular devices such as video doorbells yet it gets only 2 of 5 stars when connected to Alexa. Also, I don't see why video devices such as security cameras can't be viewed through the Alexa app. You can (sometimes) control the device through Alexa, but if you are using the Alexa app, or if you don't have one of the Echo video displays, you can't actually use the cameras through the Alexa app. This is a big limitation since why should you have to purchase yet another video screen to use with an Echo, and sometimes if you're not at home and have to use the Alexa mobile app, you ought to be able to see security camera video through the Alexa app instead of having to switch to the third party app. After all, isn't this part of the promise of ""controlling everything"" with Alexa? These issues are particularly problematic when you are out of town and trying to control things at your home, so when an item doesn't work, you may not be able to correct it (such as if it requires a hard reset). And if you want to check your security cameras, you can't get the video feed through the Alexa app. If you have any significant degree of home automation, you cannot (as far as I can tell) do it all through Alexa, you have to use multiple apps. Also, an Echo will occasionally do strange things for no reason. Yesterday, my Echo Plus started making two beeps every five minutes. All day long. My two Echo Dots did not beep, just the Echo Plus. There were no alarms or reminders set, and the Wifi in the house was fine (actually my access point is in the same room as the Echo Plus, only a few feet away, so signal strength and bandwidth are strong). When I woke up this morning, the beeping had stopped. I have no idea why. Tech support said if it wasn't an alarm or a Wifi disconnect, they had no idea why and offered to remotely reset the devices, which arguably should never be the solution for such a highly-touted system. The Alexa app is surprisingly primitive and cumbersome despite the elegance of the overall Alexa system and Echo devices. It takes too many taps to do simple things, the navigation is cumbersome, it doesn't remember your place on a screen, it is often slow to connect with the native app of the device you are trying to control, it's unattractive, and in general it's probably the weakest link in the whole system. Finally, as far as Amazon tech support, the ""pros"" are that if you dial the number, you get a live person within a minute or so, and the person you get is eager to be helpful and sounds as if they enjoy their work and want to do a good job. The ""cons"" are that unless you are lucky, you often get a person who barely speaks English fluently and you have to talk slowly and repeat yourself. Also, they rarely know the answer you are calling for off the top of their heads, and have to put you on hold while they research it. Fortunately, they are better and faster at researching the knowledge base than we are, so I often find it still better/faster to call than to try and find the answer myself although I will first do a quick Google search to see if the answer quickly pops up. Anyway, as they say, buyer beware. Overall, I like using Alexa, but you need to understand it's quirks and limitations. Some day, voice-controlled life as promised with Alexa (or competitive systems) will be here, but today is not that day.","","Great promise but poor reliability, strange happenings, primitive app, and so-so tech support","8","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFF45WVC24JX7FT2MNT5HBB35K7Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NFTVP7P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Amazon","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1RUWKH2N8ZB16/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NFTVP7P","B07NFTVP7P"

It’s amazing how much better two properly spaced speakers can sound, even without a sub. Unfortunately, Amazon decided to release this product without full feature parity of it’s competitors. As other reviews have mentioned, the stereo configuration ONLY works when streaming music from an online service. If you’re internet is out, or you want to take the speakers somewhere where no internet is available, you can only play from a single speaker at a time. That means local connection methods, like bluetooth and the 3.5mm aux in don’t play on a stereo pair (like they do with Google Home). I am really hoping this is a software kink that is quickly being worked out, and if support is added I’ll update this review. For now, I’m quite disappointed that I purchased a stereo pair of speakers and sub when half the time I only hear sound out of ONE of the three devices.

So, this is not a 'bash' Amazon or Echo review nor is this me drinking from the Amazon/Echo Kool-Aid. This is meant more as an observation of my experience with them... culminating with the Echo Plus 2. Echo-wise, there are no obvious functional differences in how all these Echos work. Appearance-wise, I really like the rounded unassuming appearance of the newer Dots and the Echo Plus. Microphone-wise, here's where there seems to be differences. In my opinion, perhaps this explains issues with Echos after the first generation. My first gen Echo is near instantaneous in the ring lighting up and the 'listening' sound (I have all of my Echos adjusted this way so I can hear actual and accidental activations). Every gen since then, seem to have a delay between the wake word being heard and the Echo responding by lighting the ring and making the activation sound. As much as I enjoy the Echo Plus 2, I have factory reset, voice retrained (from a foot away and even as far as ten feet away) and even deregistered the device several times... and there is still a half to one second delay in an acknowledgement that the device 'heard' me. Before you respond that it must be a defective device, this is my 2nd Echo Plus 2 from a completely different source... in addition, all of my Echos, after the first gen, have this similar issue. This doesn't ruin the Echo experience for me... it just tarnishes it.

So basically, I’ve got a nice looking paperweight that can say “I’m having trouble connecting to the internet.” I’ve learned my lesson with these devices and am going to sell this one on ebay for what I can get for it.","","Unusable—continuously disconnects from wifi","3","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFOL2PMPYOVV5Q5WULS6FQ5BC6DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NFTVP7P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Amazon","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EBS23W41G8GC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NFTVP7P","B07NFTVP7P"

I have been using the Echo Dot for a month and thought I would come up with the perfect anniversary gift for our 30th. The Echo is muffled and is absolutely not worth the 70 dollar price difference. On top of that it goes on sale $40 less than what I paid to add insult to injury. Because it was over 7 days I could not get a price adjustment. Should have had our anniversary a couple weeks sooner! People at work are waiting for my feedback to see if they should go with one of these and I can say with full confidence they need to pass on this one. Update: 20 minutes after I posted this review my phone rang and it was a wonderful person from Amazon by the name of Kristina. She apologized for my experience and showed me how to adjust the bass, treble and midrange to give me the sound the device was meant to put out. She also arranged for me to return the Echo and buy another one to get the sale price. This is the gold standard of customer service that other businesses should strive for.

The device will randomly reset itself to the second lowest volume setting. I will increase the volume, and it will stay increased for a while, but then will inevitably reset itself to volume level 2. This happens at least daily, sometimes multiple times a day. This started about 2 months ago. I tried factory resetting it, and when that didn't work I called Amazon expecting them to help me through this. They originally told me that this was a mass issue they were experiencing with my specific device, and that I would be added to their mass trouble ticket and given a call back to follow up. I never got a call back; three weeks later, I called to follow up. The second time I talked with Amazon, they said there was no mass ticket/issue, and they had no idea what I was talking about. Then they told me that because it was out of warranty I was SOL. The best they can do is offer me a 15% discount to buy another echo device....that I'm now sure will just break down as soon as it's out of warranty. This is the first time I've truly been disappointed in Amazon's customer service. There's no way I could be at fault for this issue; this is clearly a product issue (hardware or software, I'm not sure). But because of a policy shield, I'm screwed over. The rep even went so far as to say they couldn't be sure this type of issue wasn't my fault; how on earth could an issue like this be my fault? I expect these devices to last longer than a year and a half........ I'm extremely frustrated that Amazon is not standing by their own products, but instead is putting the customer on the hook for what is clearly a product malfunction. Buyer beware. This feels to me that Amazon knows its products will break down as soon as the warranty is up, screwing you over and banking (literally) on the assumption that you'll just continually buy new Alexa devices.","","Buyer Beware -- Amazon will screw you over.","1","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEQ53BLYVIAEEGWQ7MLSI4I4VSTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NFTVP7P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Amazon","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22HD2U7YOIFPW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NFTVP7P","B07NFTVP7P"

In fact, the Dot 3 which I moved to an adjacent room often picks up my voice commands when I am speaking to the Echo in the family room, and the Dot 3 is about 3 times the distance away with no direct line-of-sight to the family room.

The difference is definitely worth the upgrade. Voice recognition is better among other things. I love all of the features that Alexa has to offer. My son who is almost two has just recently started talking and he will randomly blurt of ""lexa playyyy shots!"". Of course he doesn't emphasize the A in Alexa so I help him out a bit and he gets a big ole grin on his face when Lil Jon and LMFAO start to play. The Alexa skills are great. The Guard mode when away also allows Alexa to listen for smoke alarms and glass breaking. This would result in a notification pushed to your phone. I would love for them to ad a feature that allowed several echo's to monitor these sounds while home. With one in the basement, kitchen, living room, and upstairs bedroom, It would be amazing if Alexa could hear a smoke detector from the basement or kitchen and then alert my bedroom echo with a very loud alarm. This would allow me to wake up much sooner since it takes a bit for smoke to get upstairs. Even then, Its hard to hear a smoke alarm in a hallway when you run a fan or window AC all night. Who wouldn't want to get out of the house before a fire got out of control? Amazon....please consider this feature. It would definitely save lives. It could even save households that keep fire extinguishers on hand. Anyways, buy this echo.

The subwoofer is great and delivers on sound - but the ECHO Plus is lacking - it is much less receptive to commands (doesn't ""hear"" or doesn't interpret them correctly), and frequently just cuts out mid-broadcast. There's a significant delay between command and response, which suggests the pairing with the subwoofer component slows the whole system. (Maybe it's a two step process - the ECHO responds, then feeds the subwoofer, then you get the audio response.) At any rate, good sound but frustrating to use. First generation ECHO's, even the refurbished ones, are far more responsive. For a sophisticated full range sound system, there may be better smart speaker systems out there. Amazon has just offered the ""Amazon Studio"", which is an all-in-one device - but expensive. As we're too far out to return our ECHO Plus, we'll have to relegate it to the garage. There are lots of smart speakers out there and though I'm pretty loyal to Amazon, it may be time to evaluate some of their competitors, at least for audiophiles who want the full spectrum of sound.","","Good idea, to add a second speaker, but slows overall function.","3","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFEF7477RJIRAZDT7YKLYLIHFSTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NFTVP7P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Amazon","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DKLVK3EG4SU5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NFTVP7P","B07NFTVP7P"

I do want to warn those who might have an issue with the Echo that they need help with to be aware that there is an online scam from a company called, ITS support, where they will try to sell you a repair contract for $149.99. I Googled Alexa (instead of calling Amazon for help) and found this site that looked like it was an Amazon site. They had me try to download the Alexa app, but the download failed each time because the website it rigged to always show a failure. That is how they get you to purchase their product. They tell you that you have viruses on your computer and go through quite an elaborate scheme, taking control of your computer, pretending to scan and clean up the so-called viruses. All of that is fake. They are not really doing anything. It only appears that way. I had a gut feeling about this and called Amazon. At Amazon, I was told that they would never try to sell you something to fix the issue and that they had no record of my call.

I had to change the password to my computer and a few other things because they almost pulled the wool over my eyes.","","Sound quality is fabulous","18","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFI2MV2E6BT4GLS6EQC5DGYYFXFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NFTVP7P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Amazon","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZCPJDG41GA3C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NFTVP7P","B07NFTVP7P"

The two echo's often get confused and stop would as a single unit would. If you say ""Alexa, do this"", sometimes the first Alexa replies and sometimes the second does. The problem is that they do not necessarily realize that one has already replied. If Echo one asks a question, sometimes Echo two hears the reply instead of Echo one causing Echo one to get stuck in a loop. Sometimes the two echos break stereo sync and require HW power cycle to get it together. One of the echo may lose the ability to ""Understand"" when in this state (this is NOT a wireless signal issue). If you set a timer on these Echos, Echo one may set the timer and Echo two may then answer all other queries. Echo two is not aware of timer on Echo one. As such, Echo two cannot list, stop, or reset timers on Echo one even though they are ""one unit"". A master/slave situation should exist when Echos are setup in stereo pairs (they are ONE unit). Turning mute on one of the Echos helps, but the mute light is distracting and annoying. In short, the sound quality gained by the stereo pair does not warrant the extreme annoyance of the buggy interaction when two Echos are placed 2.5m apart in the same room. Amazon seriously needs to work on better detection code to determine which Echo I am talking to in a multi-Echo home setup. Their implementation is horrid in close proximity (as above) and bad in simple multi-room use cases.","","Review of Double Echo/Subwoofer Setup","2","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEGRLJF26U3MKQA3MVQFLWEDN2WA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NFTVP7P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Amazon","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2P0F2ENNRHO4T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NFTVP7P","B07NFTVP7P"

I'm not keen on it spying on me but I was willing to give it a try if I could at least automate some home functions. It couldn't even do the basics. First of all you absolutely need a smart phone to use it. Alexa will not work out of the box without one. It will not pair with a desktop either. I don't subscribe to a music service as I have a literal server dedicated to music I own. Alexa can't sync to my computer to play anything from my existing library. Alexa will, however play exactly 2 random songs an then 1 minute of advertising. The ads cannot be skipped. Skipped songs count toward the two song limit before an ad. Alexa also doesn't have bluetooth or AUX line in so I can't even use it as a very expensive speaker. Which is probably for the best since the Alexa has no EQ settings to speak of so it sounds way worse than the $20 bluetooth speaker I already have for portable music. Well maybe I can use it to voice control my smart home thermostat. Nope. That Alexa skill won't install. Next I try connecting my smart TV. Why I'd need Alexa involved with my TV I have no idea, but at this point I just want something to work...for science! That Alexa skill won't install.

It's passable and the interface with other smart home products is good but it sort of feels like Amazon is cheaping out on the product now that consumer adoption is near saturation. Basically a bait and switch from Amazon; initial model is high quality to attract customers and once you have them, bring out a cheaper model. Pros - easy to setup, even for those who aren't tech savvy - interfaces with other smart products well - good deal on sale - great gift if someone doesn't have Meh - app is not as controllable as I would like - voice recognition is ok. Basic commands are flawless but anything more is beyond its capabilities Cons - speaker sound quality - asking questions gives irrelevant responses - media player in app kinda sucks to control. For example, switching from one speaker to multiple room is a little challenging in app once the music is playing I felt the same way about the echo auto.

However, there are several things I don't care for so much: First, the ""Line In"" feature doesn't work. I've contacted Amazon support and they've said a fix is on the way, but I don't have an ETA on that so for now I'm only giving this one star. This is because the primary reason I purchased this device over others was the fact that it offered a Line In feature, which my wife wanted to be able to use our old iPod to connect it to the speaker. This is a pretty big defect, especially when it is advertised as a distinguishing feature. Second, getting Alexa to recognize requests for specific albums is difficult. The phrasing has to be precise, otherwise she'll respond that she can't find the requested album and proceed to suggest something ""similar"". This wouldn't be so bad except usually I don't want to listen to something ""similar"" and I'm not so sure the suggestions are always good. This problem isn't so much unique to Alexa as I have similar issues with my google home, but google seems to be more responsive. I just don't like having to talk over Alexa to get her to stop talking so I can move on. I also find Alexa to be a bit more cold than my google home assistant, perhaps a little more robotic. I do like that the Echo Plus seems more responsive to my voice compared to the Google Home. Perhaps the mic is better in the Echo Plus than the Google Home. Sound quality is OK and is comparable to the Google Home. The ""smart"" light bulb that comes with the Echo Plus is only ""OK"". It was easy to set up, but I was disappointed that it couldn't do anything more than turn on/off and dim (I was kind of hoping for the ability to change colors). It also took me a bit of time to find a use for the bulb.

I'll not rehash that experience so Amazon will not call me again. OK if you don't have one of these Hubs they are cool and I like over Wink, GE and Hue. Hue hub I gave away but still use Wink for Zwave and Stanley locks. I run all the switches and WiFi off Alexa/Echo hub. Now I have Alexa both gen 1 and 2 hubs running. Good news this one just sync's-up and no issues so far. So why did I purchase this well for temperature sensor and most important stand alone automation when WEB is down. Temperature works great if you wish to know as she runs 1.5 to 5 degrees hotter then the room when in use especially if you are enjoying the my opinion improves sound quality. So great if you want to take her temp but a word of caution if you are running heating/cooling automation off her reading alone. As for standalone light controller when internet is out also, guess that is some enhancement as I couldn't get it to work just got the typical RED ring. Why 4 stars, 1 because it is cool, 2 because it works kind-of, 3 because I purchased it after know what gen 1 was like out of the box and 4 so Amazon won't call asking me about my review.

Big mistake. The sound is richer but the bass saturates the field leaving some words or lyrics unintelligible. But the biggest difference is that I have prime so my echo dot will play just about every song I can name instantly. However the Alexa speaker for 99 bucks will tell you that if you want to play the same song you just heard on the echo dot, you will have to pay an extra 7 bucks per month. Because obviously you don't own this thing, they want to rent the thing you just bought to you. Not really, but that is what it feels like. Furthermore it happens on too many songs. It even played a song for me one day and I guess decided I liked that song too much so it tried to upsell me on that monthly 7 buck membership again the next time I asked it to play the song. Don't buy this this contraption. Better would be to buy the dot and then a 3mm cable for etwern 5 and 19 bucks depending upon the length of the cable, then plug it into your own stereo speakers. The sound will be much better and you won't get this annoying sales pitch every time it sees you like a song too much. Horrible ethics, horrible machine. The dot is better for that reason. Google home mini is not as good with music on demand but it is way better with both sound quality and information from the net. Additionally Google is seemingly more intelligent. Echo forgets what it just told you for example if you ask it to repeat what it just said. Google just says ""sure"". And then it repeats it. Just make sure the thing you tell it last, can be repeated. It keeps a record of your requests on your phone. You can erase this optionally.

But I have to say that Echo sounds better audio quality than the portable radio. I have hearing loss due to an accident years ago, so I really shouldn't be rating sound quality, it is difficult for me to hear some tones. The Alexa app on my Android phone has a simple EQ. While it does help, it's not sensitive enough to compensate for my poor hearing. Even so, I can hear good enough to enjoy music on my Echo, which is linked in a special group with two Echo Dot devices in separate rooms. I can walk around the house and have music wherever I go. This is an awesome feature. I've learned to use it for weather and news reports as well as set reminders, timers, and lists. Plus I have some fun askingng Alexa to play Star Trek sounds and other cool stuff. I also set Alexa to ""away"" mode when I leave the house and she listens for common noises like glass breaking and will alert me if she hears anything suspicious. She's definitely not a security device. But it's nice to know she's got an ear for possible intruders and will let me know. A great feature is the relaxing music or pleasing sounds that I play when going to sleep. I especially like the ocean waves for sleeping. One issue I've experienced, Echo and Echo Dot become unresponsive once in a while. I have to unplug and reconnect power to reinitialize functionality. I'm not sure what's causing this problem? It could be my network/WiFi signal or some other problem technical problem so I can't ding Echo for the issue just yet. Luckily the issue is random and infrequent. I'm still discovering new features. I never thought I'd say this, but Alexa with Echo has enhanced the enjoyment of my home.

I have 1 Gen 1 dot, 2 Gen 2 dots, Echo buds, and all of these work well together and sound amazing for what they are so I decided to go bigger. I Should have stuck with the dots. This Echo 3rd Gen is not worth the extra money. It doesn't sound much better than the dots, and for the big kicker, they are not compatible with the dots for things like connecting for stereo sound. I mean how is Alexa not compatible with Alexa?! There is that much of a change in software between generations that Gen 2's can't talk to Gen 3's? Really? Since that is the case, they need to say that plainly in bold letters on their website instead of making me dig for it on some help section after I already bought it! I would have bought something else! As for the music, It's ok. Not much better than the Echo Dots honestly. The base is slightly more, but just slightly. For some types of music (like electric ambient music for example) it totally distorts the sound making what should sound like light clouds and sunshine sound completely discordant and more like something out of a horror flick. I mean it's usable. It's an Echo. It works like any other Echo. But it seems the more of these I buy, the harder time they have coordinating which one is going to answer and on which one the music is going to play. I mean I tell my Echo in my bedroom to play music and it plays in my living room! Then to fix it I have to unplug all of them at the same time and then plug them all back in and then they work until the next time they get all confused. I'm not sending the device back.

However, this was definitely a worthwhile upgrade. It was on a sale, so I decided to take the plunge. It's shorter and fatter than my old Echo; it has a more attractive exterior, and the sound quality is enormously better, really filling in those low and mid-range frequencies much more effectively. So, as ""Echo"", it really nailed it. Regarding the built-in Hub functionality: Complete and utter waste. I should've just bought the normal Echo instead of the Echo Plus. The built-in hub on these is a complete fail. Either commit and provide a fully functioning hub that works with all Zigbee and Zwave devices similar to the SmartThings hub, or don't bother. Or, since you're bundling it with Philips Hue bulbs, how about actually including the full Hue bridge capability in the device? The extremely limited support for the Hue bulbs is very disappointing. Overall, the ""plus"" aspects of this device feel more like a paid ""trial"" to whet your appetite for more, ultimately resulting in users buying a different (better & full-featured) smart hub and a proper Hue bridge if they are seeking either of these capabilities in their home. Shame on you Amazon. You had a chance to release a really nicely bundled piece of tech here and totally fell flat. Final word: Buy the regular Echo and use the money you saved to buy a proper smart hub such as a SmartThings and a Hue bridge if you're interested in using the Philips Hue bulbs. 5-stars for the ""Echo"" part, but maybe 2-stars for the ""Plus"" part of this device.","","Great Echo; big step up in audio quality from 1st gen Echo.

Why not get a replacement you say? I have. Same problem. If I had known these problems would persist i would have gotten a Bluetooth speaker instead. Then use an app. Also, be aware that “smart speakers” aren’t that smart. Example. Listening to audio book but would like to go back 15 seconds to hear a particular word I missed. Nope. No can do.

I'm not an audiophile, but I do like my music to sound good - which, to me, means balanced, not bass-heavy, with good clarity and a high end that doesn't become strident at higher volumes. I bought three of these to have at different locations around the house. Setup was super simple, d/l the app and sign in to your Amazon account and you're up and running. No issues at all. Here's what I love so far: Alexa is super easy to get along with...Alexa, with whom I get along easily...?...has been a treat. I've been an Amazon music user for a few years now. I like the selection but using the app on a phone or tablet is a frustrating experience, and it can also be super clunky and slow on a PC, as well. With this speaker I can ask Alexa to play a song, album or playlist and it's playing within moments. Awesome! Also, Alexa gave me a detailed, accurate weather forecast this morning. Nice! I haven't explored all the features, but I primarily want these for music. And as far as that goes, the sound quality is better than I expected, and I've got no complaints. I have one speaker on top of my fridge in the kitchen and the sound is just amazing. Balanced and clear with more than enough bass. I listened to some jazz, some alt-country, some reggae and some ambient music. They all sounded great - as good as I could hope for. And Alexa heard me from the next room without a problem. These speakers are well worth their price, and at the Black Friday price they're an incredible value. These speakers have removed my Amazon Music frustration (or a large chunk of them, anyway) and allowed me much better access to what I'm paying for.","","Fantastic!","5","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGXCV25HDW4JXI5QQSJTIZUHPRHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NFTVP7P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Amazon","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFZJH1KM9QN5C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NFTVP7P","B07NFTVP7P"

Very sturdy and no dust cracks, while retaining its simple form. One of the few times I can say you’re getting exactly what every picture on the web is showing. • I had the basic black design, but I do appreciate that Amazon is offering more colors rather than there basic set (even if it’s only a few generic colors). • The mute option is the most appreciative tool. When you activate it the classic blue glow will fall into the red, giving you the visual display that your privacy is being protected. • The sound performs exactly what it’s built for. I found no issue in testing in an open living room. The volume goes to great levels as once again, for a 360-degree smart speaker, Amazon reigns supreme. • Testing all ranges of music, I found that that bass to be rich and powerful. My colleague has the previous Echo Plus and she states that there is an improvement in the bass with this Echo. An overall rich sound when a piano came in and a warmer outcome when acoustics came into play (You’ll get the bass experience when you hit those hard beats). • Like any other model, the Bluetooth connectivity between a third party stereo works flawlessly. I tested this out with some Bose surround sound, and nothing but clear music. You can also pair the Echo if you have smaller / weaker speakers. Both together will pump up the experience. • The connectivity is so flawless that buying two of these devices (or use Echo’s previous versions, if you have one) and put them in separate locations doesn’t make this a bad idea. You’re going to get great quality in music without paying an am or a leg for it. • I have to appreciate Amazon for not pushing their music platform. They offer the usual Spotify (which I used) but also Apple Music, Deezer, TuneIn, even BBC sounds. You’re getting a lot more features than just a basic smart speaker. • Using Google Home for over a year I can say that just saying “Alexa” felt more natural than saying “Ok Google.” Not to mention having Alexa listen to me every time I said: “Alexa” (Google Home users will understand this). • Like before, smart applications fit like a glove in this system. I only used it for lights and the Echo was spot on. This feature is more common than ever on any smart speaker, and the Echo does what it’s supposed to do. • I admire the organization of the app because it’s your remote control on anything you want the Echo to do. Turn off lights, switch music, mute volume, install new features, and so forth. We all carry our phones like carrying our driver licenses when going outside. This day in age I’ll always prefer an app than a physical remote. • I did some Alexa calls on this and found only clear responses and answers (this will depend on your Wi-Fi). • I would give 70% of Alexa sounding more human. • Everything is in the cloud so, you don’t need to worry about manual updates. All taken care of. • As I mentioned before, everything else is the same in a smart speaker. Ask for the weather, traffic, upcoming appointments, and all other general questions. I didn’t test all of them because…well is the same technology as last year. • The biggest difference in my book is the price. Newer and cheaper. Cons and Oks: • No Zigbee controller. This isn’t much of an issue, but if you already have a smart house layout than you’ll need to spend some extra time configuring with the Echo. The issue for this is that it puts more work on the Echo than you need. Also, there may be some smart devices that won’t work on the Echo because of this. I know last year's models had some connectivity issues with Philips Hue bulbs. Keep an eye out for which smart devices are compatible with the Echo. • I did notice that the app slows down when you put a lot of apps and smart applications in the Echos. I tested a lot of features out that require a decent amount of downloads, but the results did create a delay in the app. I have to assume without Zigbee’s software, if you have a lot of smart applications connected to the Echo, and with the general apps you use, there will be a delay in the long run. • The Echo gets loud. Loud enough that you’ll get some distortion when you’re around 95% in volume. The effect is shown when a lot of bass is begin made. Please note that 90% and up is booming your entire house. • Compare to Google Home, Alexa still isn’t the brightest smart speak in the family. For the basic day to day task it works fine, but those random questions that we tend to have throughout the day Alexa doesn’t deliver. Alexa will usually provide you with a quick one-sentence summary (Unlike Google, it would provide you a short paragraph.). This issue doesn’t happen all the time, but you’ll notice it when it does. • I’m trying to learn Spanish, so asking smile Spanish questions with Alexa is not reliable. Example I will say “Alexa, what does “Qué estás haciendo” in Spanish mean (What are you doing?)? Alexa will say “What are you happy.” I’ve been studying for 6 moths so my speech on that sentence was spot on, but Alexa. Not a reliable study buddy. • I had the first version of the Echo and all I can say is I miss the rotation ring. Bring it back Amazon. • The design is nothing new. It’s built very solid, but it’s identical to Echo Plus 2. My colleague had the Echo Plus and putting them aside there was no way you can tell the difference (a nice note if you want to steal your friends and replace it with the last version). • Even the sound is almost similar to the previous Echo. Both are fantastic, but almost the same. Bottom Line: It’s a great smart speaker system, but almost identical in every way as its previous model. There is nothing wrong with that because Amazon does put in a lot of features into this Echo that makes this right in the top three (Google Home, HomePods, and the Echo Family). It’s accurate, excellent sound, and lower in price than its previous model. Some concerns are the effects in the long run with those who have a decent amount of smart applications, and making sure the compatibility can be performed accurately. Also knowing the limits of what Alexa can and can’t do as the hardware is identical to its previous version. I wouldn’t be surprised if you want to just read Echo’s previous model amazon reviews. Trust me when I say that they’re almost identical in sight and performance. In the end, the reason it doesn’t matter about the flaws is because the price is well worth what you’re getting. It’s a machine that I can see using it every day for the simplest things such as setting up an alarm to enjoying it in small parties. I will say that if you’re planning to use your surround sound stereo connected to this, then this is a must buy. You pay a heavy price for a HomePod, enjoy a generic performance for a Google Home, and are presented with an overall user-friendly experience with the Echo 3. Cheaper than its predecessor and the worth every penny. Overall: A tiny upgrade from its previous model, but still an excellent experience in sound for all. Hope I was a help to you.
