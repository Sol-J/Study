1,1, Reason for Danger,"Is COVID-19 claimed to get less deadly over time? If so, why?","While the data are much too sparse and noisy to give an answer about what is happening to COVID-19's virulence, or to forecast what will happen to its virulence in the future, there are indeed theoretical reasons that one might expect the virulence to decline in the future. The novel coronavirus is dangerous for several reasons, even if the number of deaths hasn’t matched that of the flu. Coronavirus is twice as contagious as the flu.A vaccine is available for the flu, but no vaccine is available for coronavirus. It's more likely they adopted those measures to slow covid-19 progression to a manageable degree. Like everything else, we're instructed by past experiences. Although there weren't a lot of data on neurologic aspects of MERS and SARS, there were some papers describing neurologic complications in those patients. Severely affected covid-19 patients may develop something that looks like GBS. Someone who's been infected by COVID-19 is asymptomatic but can spread the disease for no more than 14 days. Someone who's been infected with HIV can be asymptomatic but capable of spreading the disease for 20 years or more.  Given the long asymptomatic period of HIV and the even longer delay in identifying it as a disease, it's pretty much impossible to stop it by quarantine. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak of SARS are related to each other genetically, but the diseases they cause are quite different. COVID-19 appears to be more fatal than the flu, with some studies pegging COVID-19's fatality rate at around 3.4%, while the flu's fatality rate is less than 1%. So far this flu season in the U.S., there have been at least 38 million flu illnesses, 400,000 hospitalizations and 24,000 deaths from flu, according to the CDC. The main difference between COVID-19 and the flu is that there is a lack of immunity in the community for the new coronavirus because there is no vaccine. Swine flu has a mortality rate of around 0.01-0.1%. That’s roughly 10- to 20-fold lower than COVID-19. The big difference in Italy today is that many younger, otherwise healthier patients need critical care and more generally that patients need critical care for a long time. There is not really an inherent difference between Covid-19 and Polio from the common cold.

2,5, Stocks,Why are Central Banks cutting interest rates in response to COVID-19?,"In the current climate of coronavirus economic meltdown, the lowered interest rate has a further goal: to help protect US corporations who are now overstretched on corporate bonds. The reduced interest rate in combo with new funds, is designed to prop up the stock market and corporations to prevent socioeconomic collapse. I'm firmly of the mind the small business loan piece of Senate stimulus package is far and away the most important given what's happening right now. This was the most commonly asked question. The CARES Act not only provides relief for small business owners through loans but also allows the self-employed, independent contractors and part-time workers to collect unemployment benefits. Refinance own mortgage could be a good idea, but lenders are overwhelmed right now, so expect the process of shopping and closing to take time. When mortgage rates fall to record lows, as we’ve seen in recent weeks, refinancing can be a good way to save some extra cash. Recently, travel, leisure, airline and cruise stocks have been punished by the coronavirus outbreak.  We've seen this before though not for the same reason  when after  9/11, insurance and airlines stocks were hammered.  Just be  aware that you have no way of knowing. The remaining 12 months keep it safe in a bank or CD. Because you already have an emergency fund, and you believe your job is secure. Pay them off as quickly as safely possible. Since you have high-interest debt, getting rid of that debt is more important than maintaining a large emergency fund. Having both savings and overdraft fees is illogical
Depending on the exact neighborhood and local market, there is no guarantee that a recession will even affect the chosen neighborhood. Typically, insurance companies will cover disrupted or canceled trips (only under very specific circumstances). If they do that you will likely be able to  avoid paying the change fee. The very means of controlling the health crisis — keeping workers home, limiting travel and disrupting commerce — risk making the economic crisis worse. On March 27, Congress [passed a $2 trillion rescue package] the largest economic stimulus measure in modern history, to help the people, businesses and industries affected by the coronavirus outbreak. In its sheer scope and size, the aid plan is unprecedented and touches on every facet of American life.  Its components include stimulus payments to individuals, expanded unemployment coverage that includes the self-employed, student loan changes and much more. The steps taken to contain the outbreak, such as locking down areas and shutting down traffic flows, have shut down businesses and forced consumers to stay home. Many people have lost their jobs and their incomes, further reducing consumer spending, which makes up 60 per cent of the China economy and 70 per cent of that in the West. The International Monetary Fund has said that it expects a global recession this year. The stimulus package expands unemployment insurance benefits. There is no longer doubt that the longest global expansion on record will end this quarter. We now think that the COVID-19 shock will produce a global recession, as nearly all of the world contracts over the three months between February and April.Paying wages to temporarily unemployed is not financed through printing new money it should not really have effect on inflation. Inflation is ultimately a monetary phenomenon. we do not know how strong activity restrictions have to be to control the epidemic.

3,9, Possibility of both Flu and COVID,"Can you contract two viruses at the same time, such as new coronavirus and the flu?","While it’s still unclear if someone can contract the new coronavirus more than once, it is possible to have more than one different virus at the same time. Dr. Isaac Bogoch said it’s absolutely possible for someone to have COVID-19 and a strain of the flu or another virus simultaneously. This was the case for one patient in China, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The 69-year-old man in Wuhan had both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus. Doctors initially diagnosed the man with the flu and later diagnosed the coronavirus. The main things to monitor in new/stray cats are appetite, vomition, lethargy, runny poops, struggling or inability to urinate and breathing and eye problems. The most common symptoms of coronavirus are fever, sore throat, dry cough and fatigue. Other symptoms can also include headaches, nasal congestion or a runny nose. In most cases where symptoms present, those symptoms come together. While fever is one of the most common symptoms, it's not productive to take your temperature every day. The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. In some cases, the virus ultimately damages tiny air sacs in the lungs,restricting oxygen to the bloodstream and depriving other major organs –including the liver, kidney and brain – of oxygen. Covid-19 viruses can’t die, for the simple reason that they aren’t alive in the first place. Although they contain genetic instructions in the form of DNA, viruses can’t thrive independently. A subsequent study found that a 14-year-old boy who is youngest from China died in February after contracting the coronavirus. It’s easy for asymptomatic people to spread coronavirus. When you speak, sometimes you’ll spit a little bit. Data to date suggest that 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe infection, requiring oxygen and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation. The vast majority of people with coronavirus survive. The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has estimated the death rate is “about 2%.”. An antiviral drug must be able to target the specific part of a virus’s life cycle that is necessary for it to reproduce. And viruses are highly adaptive. So A cure take so long.",it’s absolutely possible ,

4,15, Someone in the Household Infected,My ex and I have joint custody of our kids. Is it safe for them to go between two homes?,"if parents wanted to formally modify pre-existing custody agreements, they can’t. But some states may be offering some flexibility during the pandemic. And there may be creative solutions, such as spending more time with one parent now in exchange for extra time with the other parent after the pandemic ends. Older people seem to be particularly susceptible to contracting the coronavirus, according to health officials. One way to check on homebound older residents without jeopardizing their health is to call or send a text. For people living in households with multiple residents, it may be difficult to avoid infecting each other. It’s extremely important to call the local public health hotline to discuss the exact situation so they can give you very specific recommendations based on your unique setting. Coronavirus isn’t just infecting young people. It’s killing young, healthy people as well.  We’ve reported many stories about young people getting severely sick with or dying from coronavirus. 

While specific guidelines vary from city to city, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has advised that Americans practice social distancing, and stay home, avoid mass gatherings and maintain 6 feet between themselves and others whenever possible. These efforts are intended to help ""flatten the curve,"" which means distributing the number of coronavirus cases over a longer period of time, to avoid overwhelming the health care system. Staying home prevents you from transmitting the virus to others. Quarantined at home because of COVID19, you can try to fill the gaps in your knowledge and skills. Learning something new. In case you can still move freely in your neighborhood. 

If you want to ease your anxiety about Covid-19, practice self-care whether that means doing an at-home workout, baking, maintaining a regular religious practice or journaling. Focusing on these things can help bring some peace of mind. If your anxiety is debilitating, seek out a mental health professional or other clinical mental health services. If you want to make working at home easier, Keep the same schedule. To deal with grief during pandemic time, Ms. Gottlieb recommends staying in the present as much as possible, versus thinking about the future or ruminating on things that haven’t happened yet. 

isolate when:  • they have had no fever for at least a full 72 hours without the use of medicine and  • other symptoms have gotten better and  • at least seven days have passed since their symptoms first started.In March, as more and more governments around the world hoped to slow the spread of the coronavirus, they began to impose travel restrictions. You have travelled in from overseas where there is community transmission so the possibility is much higher that you have been infected. The situation is fluid and rapidly evolving, so you should check the State Department's website often  before decision about trip. Many airlines, including Delta, United and American, are loosening their booking policies and suspending cancellation or rescheduling fees. Under EU rules you always get a refund. The extraordinary circumstances only mean that they don't have to pay any additional compensation. However, you must still be given the option of a refund, though one can accept rerouting or rebooking. Airlines are required to refund you within 7 days.

5,20, Reason for Name,Where does the name coronavirus come from?,"Coronavirus is a type of virus that causes disease in animals. Often the symptoms of the virus are those of the common cold. COVID-19 is a strain of coronavirus that is new to humans, hence it's called a novel virus. The coronavirus looks like a ball covered with spikes. Its outline is almost like a crown. That’s how coronavirus got its name, because “corona” is Latin for crown. The World Health organization known as WHO defines a pandemic as ""the worldwide spread of a new disease,"" and on March 11, the WHO's director general announced that COVID-19 met those criteria. WHO are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity and by the alarming levels of inaction. WHO have therefore made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterised as a pandemic. In February, the WHO gave official names to both this virus (SARS-CoV-2, for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and the disease it causes (Covid-19, for coronavirus disease 2019). The first identified cases of Covid-19 occurred in Wuhan China, but this does not imply that people of Chinese descent are vectors for the disease, or in any way responsible for the problems that the disease causes. Trump's very public insistence on calling this the 'Chinese virus', backed by his status as president, is guaranteed to significantly increase acts of discrimination and assault on people of Asian descent. Coronavirus was distinguished through epidemiological investigation. When medical professionals notice that a group of people with some characteristic in common, are being seen for a similar disease, they ask if there's a connection. Viruses are named based on their genetic structure to facilitate the development of diagnostic tests, vaccines and medicines. Virologists and the wider scientific community do this work, so viruses are named by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). Diseases are named to enable discussion on disease prevention, spread, transmissibility, severity and treatment. We can see that the terms 'Wuhan Virus' &amp; 'Wuhan Coronavirus' both had widespread use in English language media from the end of January up until the WHO named the disease on February 11th. The usage was comparable to the usage of the terms 'China Virus', and less commonly, 'Chinese Coronavirus'. Given a broad definition like this one, you could make a case that this is already a pandemic: COVID-19 is found on all richly inhabited continents and is continuing to spread.",outline is almost like a crown,

6,23, Mutation,Can Coronaviridae mutate into something as dangerous as Flioviridae?,"Possibility of coronaviridae mutate into something is plausible that Covid-19 could obtain mutations which allow it to transfer more quickly between humans. Mutations/replication errors/whatever will happen in the creation of new virus particles within a host cell. There is some distribution of number of mutational events that will occur as a function of the number of new RNA molecules created per cell and the replication error rate. Among all those viruses which continue successfully infecting throughout the course of a year, on average we observe 24 substitution mutations in the genome over the course of that year. Every transmission chain included in the group of viruses at the end of the year must have remained viable for infection of hosts. In other words, it has survived natural selection. Mutations are mostly deleterious to begin with. This means that mutant copies of virus only very rarely survive and proliferate. A virus that is deadlier will already be less likely to reproduce, having killed more hosts. There has been at least one phylogenetic study of 48 near complete samples of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 2019-nCoV also has enveloped virions that measure approximately 50–200 nm in diameter with a single positive-sense RNA genome.",plausible,

7,25, Conspiracy,Is it possible for coronavirus or SARS to be synthetic?,"The scenarios which is possible for coronavirus or SARS to be synthetic are impossible and would be laughable if they were not so serious. The evidence is in the phylogenetic trees. Coronaviruses are a relatively broad family of viruses named for the spikes that come out of a virus particle. Under a microscope, they look like a crown, or a halo — like the sun’s corona. The current coronavirus first emerged from Wuhan, in China’s Hubei Province, most likely from a fish and animal market where humans routinely come into direct contact with animals. The virus probably jumped from an animal — we still don’t know for sure what species — to a human, a process of interspecies transmission called zoonosis. Bats are reservoirs of many important human pathogens, some are emerging infections (e.g., 2019-NCoV, the coronavirus in the news recently), and some are not. Contact between humans and bats is certainly not a new phenomena, but there is more required for an emerging infection than a reservoir and a new host. There must be some bridge that allows a virus to cross a previously effective species barrier. Both host and coronavirus tend to evolve to a point where the immune system wins most, but not all of the time. In conclusion, we don't really need to look for special properties of bats to explain their tolerance of coronaviruses, even though, as iayork points out, there are reasons to expect bats might be more resistant. The preponderance of links between bat and human pathogens has led to a debate about whether bats disproportionately contribute to emerging viral infections crossing the species barrier into humans. In fact, why bats are such a frequent source of pathogenic human viruses remains a tantalizing mystery.
There are a few major points taken up by conspiracy theories. 
1. SARS-CoV-2 leaked from a lab, in which research on the Bat CoV (RaTG13) was done.
2. The S (spike) protein from bat SARS-CoV cannot be used to enter human cells via the human ACE2 receptor and therefore has been adapted in the lab.
3. The spike protein of SARS-CoV contains a unique inserted sequence (1378 bp) located in the middle of its spike glycoprotein gene that had no match in other coronaviruses.
4. The claim that SARS-CoV-2 contains four insertions from HIV-1.
5. The claim that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is completely man-made.",impossible ,

8,28, Alternative Disinfection,Can the heat from a hand dryer kill coronavirus?,"To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. Study on MERS coronavirus and HCoV-229E: ""rapidly lost most of the infectivity in fasted-state simulated gastric fluid (FaSSGF; pH 2.0)"" but ""survived FeSSGF"" (fed state, which is less acidic). Hand dryers can’t kill coronavirus, according to WHO. Drinking hot water or taking hot baths won’t kill it, either. If you consume a lot of alcohol, it can make you drowsy and can compromise your immunity. Experts say that this might make you aspirate and that will make you susceptible to viruses. FSIS Cleaning Regulations 5 Steps of cleaning and disinfection. So partly this depends on how sanitized you want things to be.  For my part, I just clean my counters with a mixture of Simple Green (a concentrated organic soap) and water.  If you're really concerned, you could do a second washing with a weak bleach solution. Cleaning should precede disinfection. Disinfection is biocidal elimination on fomite surfaces of microorganisms, in this instance SARS-CoV-2. After applying disinfecting dilution be sure to allow it adequate action time and then allow surface to air dry. When CDC says to use “5 tablespoons (aka 1/3 cup) bleach per gallon of water”. Now, the CDC “recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.”  The public should NOT buy surgical masks or N95 respirator masks. Instead, make your own cloth mask. US Surgeon General Jerome Adams shows how to make face masks with just a T-shirt and rubber bands in this CDC video. The main benefit of wearing masks in public isn’t to protect you from getting sick. As Covid-19 is spread through droplets, it can reach us through the air. Therefore, maintain social distancing, which means remaining 6 feet away from others.  Ideally, you shouldn't touch any surface on which droplets may have landed. The best way to protect yourself from exposed surfaces is to wash your hands frequently with soap and water for a count of 20. Self-isolate  only applies to those who have recently come back from overseas, or if you've been in contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. But if you are one of those people who has to self-isolate, it means that you should avoid all other public gatherings. The No 1 thing you can do to protect yourself from coronavirus infection is to wash your hands, often and thoroughly.And avoid big gatherings. If you rely on public transportation, use caution. If you’re sick or live in an area where an outbreak has been reported, avoid it. Mass transit could increase your risk of exposure to coronavirus. If you can, you should stay home from work when you’re sick, whether or not you have coronavirus. Many companies are increasingly flexible with work from home policies. If your company is allowing employees to work from home, consider it. Spain itself does not seem particularly risky, it's not the country most impacted in Europe. If you want to safely take care of someone who's sick, Asking the sick person to wear a face mask. If the mask causes breathing difficulties, then the caretaker should wear a mask instead. If your child is worried about the coronavirus, listen to him or her, rather than respond with comments like, “It’ll be fine.” Dismissive reactions can make children feel like they’re not being heard. While there have been suggestions that a regular flu shot can help protect individuals against COVID-19, Bogoch said that’s not true.",can’t kill the virus,

9,35, Accuracy,Prediction model for spread of coronavirus,"The original R0 calculation was developed in the early 1900s to model malaria transmission and is known as the Ross-MacDonald model so your idea is over 100 years old. One thing R0 of COVID-19 will identify is the latent period transmission which occurs before the symptoms, i.e. the incubation period. Essentially, people with cough/mild symptoms before they self isolate and become really ill with a lung infection will transmit the virus. In this context R0 will be/was very influential for understanding when to move between quarantine and containment phases of the pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported at least 81,191 cases of coronavirus as of Wednesday morning. Of the 81,191 confirmed cases, 2,768 people have died, a mortality rate of about 3 percent.  It's people that are already seriously ill or already have weak immune systems that are most likely to die soon after contracting Covid-19.  And it's when people are clustered in a close community that they are most likely to contract the disease. Ages range of U.S. deaths from COVID-19 from an infant less than one year old to people intheir 90s, according to state and local health departments. When people talk about the mortality rate of a disease, what they usually mean is the case fatality rate or the death-to-case ratio, which is simply defined as Nd /  Ni, where  Nd is the number of deaths attributed to the disease over a given time period and Ni is the total number of new cases of the disease observed during the same time period.  By this definition, the current case fatality rate of 2019-nCov according to your quoted figures is 362 / 17491 ≈ 2.07%. If you want to forecast COVID19 through package R, you can force ets() to use a model with multiplicative trend (and multiplicative error) by using the parameter model=""MMN"". The main comprehensive public dataset we have available for the COVID-19 virus is the data held and updated by the John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre at John Hopkins University.  This is the repository of data that is being used for the vast majority of media reports and data visualisations on the spread of COVID-19.  The database has data on confirmed infections, recoveries, and deaths, plus GIS data on where these occurred.  The data is sourced from the WHO and various national health departments, and it is being updated frequently.

10,38, Education,How to ask for excused absences or switching to online class,"Most institutions, such as universities, will also have issued official advice which you should also read and follow. Schools are closed for different lengths of time, and it's unclear when it will be safe to go back. It’s likely that the coronavirus pandemic will have a major impact on your daily life in the short term. Mass events will be cancelled, sporting games will be played to empty stadiums, and it’s likely that at some point your workplace might ask you to work from home. Journals are ways of disseminating scientific information, and they do take into account what is of current interest like COVID-19. This current emergency can be considered to be an opportunity to rethink everything we do toward finding better ways to educate people. We are forced to act and the old ways don't work in a new environment. We should be looking for new ways. In online learning platform given COVID-19 pandemic,it seems that pretty much everything must now be done in virtual space. And, this is hard to arrange in the short term. But in addition to videos, there is the possibility of software to provide hands-on simulation in some cases. Germany border restricted for EU nationals Covid19, But you would potentially be allowed to enter. If you are not married to your partner, her picking you up will only help mildly, as they cannot easily check if you are family. You can, however, bring your work contract to prove that you have to start there on day X. There is also a question of politics and timing : on Thursday morning all parties in French goverment asked that it be maintained, so they had to decide that. Politically it was too late, cancelling the elections would go against advice given by all parties on Thursday morning. Since Macron was expected to lose the elections, cancelling the election after every other party expressed against it would have been seen as an antidemocratic political maneuver. Right now, as Covid-19 is on-going, they can't do very much to prepare for a hypothetical Covid-??. However, once the Covid-19 situation has ended, then it would be vital to do a thorough analysis of what worked, and didn't work in the Covid-19 situation. In general if a government (or an airline) doesn't stop travellers or planes, you will have no direct refund. It means that both think that there is no danger. So usually it is recommended to have a travel insurance. The rights created by the First Amendment are not absolute. They are subject to reasonable restrictions as to time, place and manner, especially if those restrictions are content neutral. In the most recent polls I found from March 26: About seven-in-ten adults (71%) say that to address the coronavirus, it is necessary to require most businesses other than grocery stores or pharmacies to close. Several states have already postponed their primaries. Officials in states that are going ahead with primaries have been trying to emphasize the new basics of voting hygiene, like using hand sanitizer at polling stations. People with fever will not be allowed to board. Therefore, it's advised that you follow basic prevention measures, such as washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth, cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze, wear a mask, etc. Trump has never had better ratings.

11,44, Fear,How worried should I be about getting sick?,"Everyone should be concerned about contracting the new coronavirus — if not for yourself, then to protect others who are at risk of becoming severely ill. Experts have warned about the risk that if tough measures are taken too soon, “fatigue” may set in, prompting the public to disregard the advice just as coronavirus reaches its peak. While the W.H.O. is supposed to coordinate the global response to epidemics, the group, a U.N. agency, doesn’t have the authority to force countries to follow its plan.  Culture and government also play a role. Governments worldwide have made major mistakes in trying to contain the outbreak. But as the virus spreads, South Korea, Singapore and China have been more effective than others at bringing it under control. South Korea has adopted a highly technical and transparent approach to Covid-19.  By sharing where infected people have been, citizens can see if they have been in contact or near contact with the infected person, and then request a test. At the moment, the federal government is doing a lot of warning. The CDC has produced two dozen guidance documents for hospitals, instructions for preparedness and infection control. Crucially, they are offering guidance on preserving personal protection equipment in a recognition that a widespread outbreak is likely to impact already-low supplies. While the declaration of a PHEIC is applicable globally, the temporary recommendations issued as a result of the declaration are not required to be, and in general, aren't. Philippines and Peru decide ban outbound international flights during pandemics. Americans have grown accustomed to “just-in-time” ordering. But that becomes a huge problem when international supply chains are disrupted by an outbreak. Therefore, US doesn't have enough medical supplies to handle this outbreak. Experts say the reason of US so far behind other countries with testing is due to cuts in federal funding for public health and problems with early testing. Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. The coronavirus relief bill is not yet law, and the IRS has yet to provide information about how it plans to implement the provision about the rebates. Will the hospitals remain open? Yes. Hospitals will operate normally.

Hard to see the progress here - it's likely going to be much, much longer before life feels like normal again, right? I mean, many schools have extended closures. There'll be lots of distance learning going on. Summer or humidity can't kill Covid-19. We have seen tropical countries like Singapore report a good number of cases despite humidity. During summers, people generally spend more time indoors and in air-conditioned spaces, where the temperature is low. This can instead spread the virus.

13,50, Accuracy,How soon after exposure can you test positive?,"We do know that someone infected with coronavirus may begin showing symptoms anywhere between one and 14 days after catching the virus, most commonly around five days, according to the WHO. The CDC (Centers for Disease Control) and the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) are both US federal agencies that have overlapping authority over medical testing in the US. In general federal rules prevail over state rules, so the CDC can stop the state of New York from testing for COVID-19 if the CDC has not approved the testing protocol. The CDC covers the cost of COVID-19 testing itself, however, this may not be the only type of cost incurred. There are two general categories of tests typically used for identifying viral infections: those based on viral genetic material and those based on host immune response. If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, the CDC recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Your doctor will tell you if you need to get tested. Not sure if you should get tested? The CDC website features a ""self-checker"" to help you make decisions about seeking medical care. Testing methods may include a blood test, a swab test inside your nose or in the back of your throat, or a sputum test, which examines a mix of saliva and mucus. China has been using antibody testing to see if people had been exposed in their convalescent phase. The USA didn't want to do antibody testing and have wanted to recover virus using a PCR test, but PCR won't show historical infection. Tests are limited and most state does not have formal criteria for determining who should be tested, meaning guidelines vary from province to province. Health-care workers are generally advised to prioritize testing only those who are showing symptoms of COVID-19. Testing positive means that you have coronavirus, but it does not mean that you will develop symptoms. Some people who have the virus don't have any symptoms at all. At the same time, testing negative does not necessarily mean that you don't have the virus. Coronavirus test kit contains primers and probes for real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR, as well as instructions for appropriate use and controls and guidelines to avoid false positives and negatives.

14,55, Antibody Immunity,"After recovering from coronavirus, does a person have long-term immunity to the virus?","With “common cold coronaviruses, you don’t actually have immunity that lasts for very long, and so we don’t know the answer with this specific coronavirus,” said Dr. Celine Gounder, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the New York University School of Medicine. It seems likely that having the disease once results in immunity in most individuals - as is seen with other coronaviruses. This means that people who initially recovered are more likely to relapse rather than get reinfected with the virus. But, that doesn’t mean it isn’t possible to contract the disease again, especially in those who are immunocompromised. Because COVID-19 is a new virus, we don't know whether pregnant women are more susceptible than the general population. Although people aged under 18 are less susceptible to coronavirus, according to the limited clinical reports available. The degree to which you feel pain depends on your underlying health. Donor blood is not being used to treat coronavirus patients, but transfusions are still needed for cases like organ transplants or complications of childbirth. It's not yet clear whether people can be reinfected by this coronavirus or how long immunity might last after infection. If you do an antibody test, in theory it could show that you had the virus and then recovered. It makes sense to wash unpackaged items such as fruit and vegetables thoroughly under running water, before leaving them to dry. You should also then wash your hands with soap and water. A study of previous coronaviruses found human coronaviruses could theoretically last on surfaces at room temperature for up to nine days. This may vary under different conditions. Covid-19 is the result of a zoonotic outbreak from bats to an intermediate thence to humans.  It is thought that bats don't suffer the disease themselves as they carry low levels of virus but the intermediate host modifies the virus, and amplifies it so that it vastly increases the amount of virus that can shed into the environment infecting humans. There have been no cases of pets or insect passing the coronavirus to humans, and the same was true during the Sars outbreak in 2003, when there was not a single case of pet-to-human transmission. Coronavirus spreads from person to person by droplets from the nose or mouth from coughing or sneezing. People can also catch it by coming into contact with contaminated surfaces or skin. The WHO says ""other people then catch Covid-19 (coronavirus) by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth"". There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19.",we don’t know the answer,
