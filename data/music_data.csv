Gobble me swallow me
Drip down inside of me
Quick jump out
'fore you let it get inside of me
I tell him where to put it
never tell him where I’m about to be
I run down on him
Before I let a nigga running me

Bite yo lip
Ask for a car while you ride that dick
You really ain’t never gotta
fuck him for a thang
He already made his mind up

Pay my tuition just to kiss me

79,30,"Lose Yourself (From ""8 Mile"" Soundtrack)",Eminem,"Look if you had
one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever
wanted in
one moment
Would you capture it
just let it slip
yo
His palms are sweaty
knees weak arms
are heavy There's
vomit on his sweater already
mom's spaghetti
He's nervous but on the
surface
looks calm and ready
To drop bomb but he keeps
on forgetting what he
wrote down
The whole crowd goes
so loud
he opens his mouth
But the words won't
come out
He's chokin' how
everybody's chokin' now
The clocks run out
times up over bloah
Snap back to reality
oh there goes gravit
oh There goes rabbit he
choked
he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy no
he won't have it he knows
His whole back's of
these ropes
it don't matter he's dope
He knows that but he's broke
he so stagnant that he knows
When he goes back to this
mobile home that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo
This whole raposedy
better go capture this
moment And hope it don't
You better lose
yourself in the music
The moment you own it
you better never let it go
You only get one shot
do not miss your chance
to blow
This opportunity comes
once in a life time yo
You better lose
yourself in the music
The moment you own it
you better never let it go
You only get one shot
do not miss your chance
to blow
This opportunity comes
once in a life time yo
His souls escaping
through this hole that
is gaping
This world is mine for
the taking
make me king
As we move toward'a
new world ord'a
a normal life is boring
But superstardoms
close to post mortum
It only grows harder
only grows hotter
He blows it's all over
these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows he's
known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads god
only knows
he's grown farther
from home
He's no father he
goes home
and barely knows his
own daughter
But hold your nose
'cause here goes the
cold water
These hoes don't want
him no mo'
he's cold product
They moved on to the
next shmo'
who flows he nose
dove and
sold nada
So the soap opera's
told it unfolds i
suppose it's old
partner But the beat goes on
da da dum da da dum datta
You better lose
yourself in the music
The moment you own it
you better never let it go
You only get one shot
do not miss your chance
to blow
This opportunity comes
once in a life time yo
yourself in the music
The moment you own it
you better never let it go
You only get one shot
do not miss your chance

No more games
I'ma change what you
call rage
Tear this mother fuckin
roof off like 2 dogs caged
I was playin in the beginning
the mood all changed
I been chewed up
and spit out and booed
off stage
But I kept rhymin' and step
writin' the next cypher
You best believe
somebody's payin' the
pied piper
All the pain inside
amplified by the
fact that I can't
get by with my nine to
five And I can't
provide the right type'a
Life for my family
'cause man These goddamn
food stamps don't buy
diapers
And it's no movie
there's no Mekhi Phifer
This is my life
and these times are so hard
And it's getting even harder
tryin' to feed and water
my seed plus
Teetertotter caught up
between
bein' a father
and a prima donna Baby
mama drama's screamin'
on and
Too much for me to wanna
stay in one spot
another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point
I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot
'fore I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only
motherfuckin'
option failure's not
Mom I love you but this
trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in
Salem's lot
So here I go it's my shot
feet fail me not This maybe
only opportunity that I got
You better lose

83,34,Love The Way You Lie (Feat. Rihanna),Eminem,"Just gonna stand there and
watch me burn
But that's alright
because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and
hear me cry
But that's alright
because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you
what it feels like and right now
there's a steel knife
in my windpipe
I can't breathe
but I still fight
while I can fight
as long as the wrong
feels right It's like
I'm in flight
High of a love drunk from the hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and
I love the more
I suffer I sufficate and
right before im about to drown
She resuscitates me
She fucking hates me
and I love it Wait
Where you going
I'm leaving you
No you ain't Come back
We're running right back
Here we go again It's so insane
Cause when it's going good
It's going great
I'm Superman
with the wind in his bag
She's Lois Lane
But when it's bad It's awful
I feel so ashamed I snap
Who's that dude
I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her
I'll never stoop so low again
I guess
I don't know my own strength
Just gonna stand there and
watch me burn
But that's alright because
I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and
hear me cry
But that's alright because
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
You ever love somebody so much
You can barely breathe
when you're with them You meet
And neither one of you
Even know what hit'em
Got that warm fuzzy feeling
Yeah them chills Used to get'em
Now you're getting fucking sick
Of looking at'em
You swore you've never hit'em
Never do nothing to hurt'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewing venom and these words
when you spit'em
You push Pull each other's hair
Scratch claw bit'em
Throw'em down Pin'em
So lost in the moments
When you're in'em
It's the rage that took over
It controls you both
So they say it's best
To go your separate ways
Guess that they
don't know ya Cause today
That was yesterday
Yesterday is over
It's a different day
Sound like broken records
Playin over
But you promised her
Next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance
Life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave
Out the window
Guess that's why they
call it window pane
Just gonna stand there and
watch me burn
But that's alright
because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and
hear me cry
But that's alright
because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Now I know we said things
Did things
That we didn't mean
And we fall back into the same
patterns same routine
But your temper's
just as bad as mine is
You're the same as me
but when it comes to love
You're just as blinded
Baby please come back
It wasn't you
Baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as
crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens
when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is
I love you too much
To walk away though
Come inside Pick up your bags
off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity
In my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault
Look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed
I'll aim my fist
At the dry wall
Next time
There will be no next time
I apologize Even though
I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games
I just want her back
I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking
leave again
I'mma tie her to the bed
And set the house on fire
Just gonna stand there and
watch me burn
But that's alright
because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and
hear me cry
But that's alright
because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie",Rap

Back again
Shady's back
Tell a friend

Guess who's back
Guess who's back
I've created a monsta
'cuz nobody wants to
See Marshall no more
They want Shady
I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady
This is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with
some hard liquor
Some vodka that will jump
Start my heart quicka
Then a shock when I get shocked
at the hospital
By the doctor
when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rockin' the table
while he's operating Hey
You waited this long to stop debating
Cuz I'm back
I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job
Mrs. Cheney
But your husband's
heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me
So let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So come on dip bum on your lips
Fuck that
Come on your lips
and some on your tits
And get ready
'cuz this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits
Fuck you Debbie
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy
'Cuz it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy
'Cuz it feels so empty without me
Little hellions kids feelin' rebellious
Embarrassed their parents
still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like
prisoners helpless
Til someone comes along
on a mission and yells BITCH
A visionary vision is scary
could start a revolution
Pollutin' the air waves
A rebel
So let me just revel and bask
In the fact that
I got everyone kissin' my ass
And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn
Much of my ass you asked for me
Well I'm back
Da Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na
fix your bent antenna
Tune it in and then
I'm gonna enter into
The front of your skin
like a splinter
The center of attention
back for the winter
I'm interesting the best thing
since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
Testing Attention Please
Feel the tension soon as
someone mentions me
Here's my 10 cents
My 2 cents is free
A nuisance who sent
you sent for me
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy
'Cuz it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy
'Cuz it feels so empty without me
A tiskit a taskit
I go tit for tat with anybody
who's talkin' this shit that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick
You can get your ass kicked
Worse than them
little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby you can get
stoned by Obie
You 36 yearold
baldheaded fag blow me
You don't know me
You're too old
Let go it's over
Nobody listens to techno
Now let's go
Just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list
full of new insults
I been dope suspenseful
with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself
into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean
I'm disgusting
But it's just me
I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king
of controversy
I am the worst thing
since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy
Hey
There's a concept that works
20 million other
white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish
in the sea
It'll be so empty without me
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy
'Cuz it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy
'Cuz it feels so empty without me",Rap
